    The point <m>(x,y,z)</m> satisfies <m>x^2 +y^2+z^2= 2x-4y+4</m>

      from <m>(1, -2, 0)</m> to <m>(x,y,z)</m>, our point satisfies the given equation
      if and only if its distance from <m>(1,-2,0)</m> is three. So the set is

Consider any triangle. Pick a coordinate system so that one vertex

the coordinates of the second vertex <m>(a,0)</m> and those of the third vertex

The circumscribing circle has centre <m>(\bar x,\bar y)</m> and radius <m>r</m>

<solution><p>
For each fixed <m>c\ge 0</m>, the isobar <m>p(x,y)=c</m> is the curve
<m>x^2-2cx+y^2=3c^2</m>, or equivalently, <m>(x-c)^2+y^2=4c^2</m>. This is a
circle with centre <m>(c,0)</m> and radius <m>2c</m>.  Here is a sketch of the isobars
<m>p(x,y)=c</m> with <m>c=0,1,2,3</m>.

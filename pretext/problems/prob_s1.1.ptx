    The point <m>(x,y,z)</m> satisfies <m>x^2 +y^2+z^2= 2x-4y+4</m>
      if and only if it satisfies <m>x^2-2x +y^2+4y+z^2= 4</m>, or equivalently
      <m>(x-1)^2 +(y+2)^2+z^2=9 </m>. Since <m>\sqrt{(x-1)^2 +(y+2)^2+z^2}</m> is the distance
      from <m>(1, -2, 0)</m> to <m>(x,y,z)</m>, our point satisfies the given equation
      if and only if its distance from <m>(1,-2,0)</m> is three. So the set is
      the sphere of radius 3 centered on <m>(1,-2,0)</m>.

      As in part (a), <m>x^2 +y^2+z^2 \lt  2x-4y+4</m>
      if and only if  <m>(x-1)^2 +(y+2)^2+z^2 \lt 9 </m>. Hence our point
      satifies the given inequality
      if and only if its distance from <m>(1,-2,0)</m> is strictly smaller than three.
      The set is the interior of the sphere of radius 3 centered on <m>(1,-2,0)</m>.

<statement><p>
Consider any triangle. Pick a coordinate system so that one vertex
is at the origin and a second vertex is on the positive <m>x</m>-axis. Call
the coordinates of the second vertex <m>(a,0)</m> and those of the third vertex
<m>(b,c)</m>. Find the circumscribing circle (the circle that goes through all
three vertices).
</p></statement>

<answer><p>
The circumscribing circle has centre <m>(\bar x,\bar y)</m> and radius <m>r</m>
with <m>\bar x=\frac{a}{2}</m>, <m>\bar y=\frac{b^2+c^2-ab}{2c}</m> and
<m>r=\sqrt{\big(\frac{a}{2}\big)^2+\big(\frac{b^2+c^2-ab}{2c}\big)^2}</m>.
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
Call the centre of the circumscribing circle
<m>(\bar x,\bar y)</m>. This centre must be equidistant from the three vertices.
So
<me>
\bar x^2+\bar y^2=(\bar x-a)^2+\bar y^2=(\bar x-b)^2+(\bar y-c)^2
</me>
or, subtracting <m>\bar x^2+\bar y^2</m> from the three equal expressions,
<me>
0=a^2-2a\bar x=b^2-2b\bar x+c^2-2c\bar y
</me>
which implies
<me>
\bar x=\frac{a}{2}\qquad\qquad \bar y
=\frac{b^2+c^2-2b\bar x}{2c}=\frac{b^2+c^2-ab}{2c}
</me>
The radius is the distance from the vertex <m>(0,0)</m> to the centre
<m>(\bar x,\bar y)</m>, which is
<m>\sqrt{\big(\frac{a}{2}\big)^2+\big(\frac{b^2+c^2-ab}{2c}\big)^2}</m>.

A certain quadric surface consists of all points <m>P=(x,y,z)</m>

sketch and describe it verbally.

<answer><p>
<m>x^2+y^2=4z</m>
The surface is a paraboloid consisting of a stack of horizontal circles, starting with a point at the origin and with radius increasing vertically.
The circle in the plane <m>z=z_0</m> has radius <m>2\sqrt{z_0}</m>.
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
The distance from <m>P</m> to the point <m>(0,0,1)</m> is <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-1)^2}</m>.
The distance from <m>P</m> to the specified plane is <m>|z+1|</m>. Hence the equation
of the surface is
<me>
x^2+y^2+(z-1)^2=(z+1)^2\text{ or }
   x^2+y^2=4z

All points on this surface have <m>z\ge 0</m>. The set of points on the surface

centred on the <m>z</m>-axis, is parallel to the <m>xy</m>-plane and has radius

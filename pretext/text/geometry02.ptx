  <title>Vectors</title>
<introduction>

<p>In many of our applications in 2d and 3d, we will encounter quantities
that have both a magnitude (like a distance) and also a
direction. Such quantities are called vectors. That is,
a <em>vector</em> is a quantity which has both a direction and a magnitude,
like a velocity. If you are moving, the magnitude (length) of your
velocity vector is your speed (distance travelled per unit time)  and the
direction of your velocity vector is your direction of motion. To specify
a vector in three dimensions you have to give three components, just as for
a point. To draw the vector with components <m>a, b, c </m> you can draw
an arrow from the point <m>(0,0,0)</m> to the point <m>(a,b,c)</m>.
</p>

</sidebyside>

<p>
Similarly, to specify a vector in two dimensions
you have to give two components and to draw the vector
with components <m>a, b </m> you can draw an arrow from the point <m>(0,0)</m>
to the point <m>(a,b)</m>.
</p>


<p>There are many situations in which it is preferable to draw a vector
with its tail at some point other than the origin. For example, it is
natural to draw the velocity vector of a moving particle with the tail
of the velocity vector at the position of the particle, whether or not
the particle is at the origin. The sketch below shows a moving particle
and its velocity vector at two different times.
</p>

  <image source="figs/movingParticle"/>
  </sidebyside>

<p>
As a second example, suppose that you are analyzing the motion of a pendulum.
There are three forces acting on the pendulum bob: gravity <m>\vg</m>, which
is pulling the bob straight down, tension <m>\vt</m> in the rod, which is
pulling the bob in the direction of the rod, and air resistance <m>\vr</m>,
which is pulling the bob in a direction opposite to its direction of motion.
All three forces are acting on the bob. So it is natural to draw all three
arrows representing the forces with their tails at the bob.
</p>

<sidebyside width="20%">
<image source="figs/pendulum"/>
</sidebyside>


<p>In this text, we will used bold faced letters, like <m>\vv</m>, <m>\vt</m>, <m>\vg</m>,
to designate vectors. In handwriting, it is clearer to use a small
overhead arrow<fn>
    Some people use an underline, as in <m>\underline{v}</m>, rather than an arrow.</fn>,
as in <m>\vec{v}</m>, <m>\vec{t}</m>, <m>\vec{g}</m>, instead.
Also, when we want to emphasise that some quantity is a number,
rather than a vector, we will call the number a <em>scalar</em>.
</p>

<p>
Both points and vectors in 2d are specified by two numbers. Until
you get used to this, it might confuse you sometimes <mdash/> does a given pair of
numbers represent a point or a vector?
To distinguish<fn>
  Or, in the Wikipedia jargon, disambiguate.
</fn>
between the components of a vector and the coordinates
of the point at its head, when its tail is at some point other than
the origin, we shall use angle brackets rather than round brackets
around the components of a vector. For example, the figure below shows
the two-dimensional vector <m>\llt 2,1\rgt</m> drawn in three different positions.
In each case, when the tail is at the point <m>(u,v)</m> the head is at
<m>(2+u,1+v)</m>. We warn you that, out in the  real world<fn>
  OK. OK. Out in that (admittedly very small) part of the real world that actually knows
what a vector is.
</fn>,
no one uses notation
that distinguishes between components of a vector and the coordinates of its
head <mdash/> usually round brackets are used for both. It is up to you to
keep straight which is being referred to.

  <title>Addition of Vectors and Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar</title>

<p>Just as we have done many times in the CLP texts, when we define a new
type of object, we want to understand how it interacts with the basic
operations of addition and multiplication. Vectors are no different, and
we shall shortly see a natural way to define addition of vectors.
Multiplication will be more subtle, and we shall start with multiplication of a vector by a number (rather than with multiplication of a vector by
another vector).
</p>

<p>
By way of motivation for the definitions of addition and multiplication by a number, imagine that we are out for a walk on the <m>xy</m>-plane.
<ul>
<li> 
Suppose that we take a step and, in doing so, we move <m>a_1</m> units parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis and <m>a_2</m> units parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis. 
Then we say that <m>\llt a_1, a_2\rgt</m> is the displacement vector for the step. Suppose now that we take a second step which moves us an additional <m>b_1</m> units  parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis and an additional <m>b_2</m> units  parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis, as in the figure on the left below. So the displacement 
vector for the second step is <m>\llt b_1, b_2\rgt</m>. All together, we have moved <m>a_1+b_1</m> units  parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis and <m>a_2+b_2</m> units parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis. The displacement vector for the two steps combined is  
<m>\llt a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2\rgt</m>. We shall define
the sum of <m>\llt a_1, a_2\rgt</m> and <m>\llt b_1, b_2\rgt</m>, denoted by
<m>\llt a_1, a_2\rgt+\llt b_1,b_2\rgt</m>, to be <m>\llt a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2\rgt</m>.
</li>
<li>
Suppose now that, instead, we decide to step in the same direction
as the first step above, but to move twice as far, as in the figure on the right below. That is, our step will move us <m>2a_1</m> units in the direction of the <m>x</m>-axis and <m>2a_2</m> units in the direction of the <m>y</m>-axis and the 
corresponding displacement vector will be <m>\llt 2a_1, 2a_2\rgt</m>. 
We shall define the product of the number <m>2</m> and the vector
<m>\llt a_1, a_2\rgt</m>, denoted by <m>2\llt a_1, a_2\rgt</m>, to be 
<m>\llt 2a_1, 2a_2\rgt</m>.
</li>
</ul>

  <title>Adding Vectors and Multiplying a Vector by a Number</title>

    These two operations have the obvious definitions

  \va=\llt a_1,a_2\rgt,\ \vb =\llt b_1,b_2\rgt

and similarly in three dimensions.
</p></statement>
</definition>

<p>
Pictorially, you add the vector <m>\vb</m> to the vector <m>\va</m>
by drawing <m>\vb</m> with its tail at the head of <m>\va</m> and then drawing
a vector from the tail of <m>\va</m> to the head of <m>\vb</m>, as in the figure
on the left below. For a number <m>s</m>, we can draw the vector <m>s\va</m>, by
just
<ul>
<li>
changing the vector <m>\va</m>'s length by the factor <m>|s|</m>, and,
</li>
<li>
if <m>s \lt 0</m>, reversing the arrow's direction,
</li>
</ul>
as in the other two figures below.

  </sidebyside>
<p>
The special case of multiplication by <m>s=-1</m> appears so frequently that
<m>(-1)\va</m> is given the shorter notation <m>-\va</m>. That is,
<me>
-\llt a_1,a_2\rgt=\llt -a_1,-a_2\rgt
</me>
Of course <m>\va+(-\va)</m> is <m>\vZero</m>, the vector all of whose components
are zero.
</p>

<p>
  To subtract <m>\vb</m> from <m>\va</m> pictorially, you may add <m>-\vb</m> (which is drawn by reversing the direction of <m>\vb</m>) to <m>\va</m>.
  Alternatively, if you draw <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m> with their tails at a common point, then <m>\va-\vb</m> is the vector from the head of <m>\vb</m> to the head of <m>\va</m>.
  That is, <m>\va-\vb</m> is the vector you must add to <m>\vb</m> in order to get <m>\va</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="40%">

  The operations of addition and multiplication by a scalar that we have just
defined are quite natural and rarely cause any problems, because
they inherit from the real numbers the properties of  addition and
multiplication that you are used to.

</definition>


<p>There are some vectors that occur sufficiently commonly that they are
given special names. One is the vector <m>\vZero</m>. Some others are the
<q>standard basis vectors</q>.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def_basis_vectors">
<statement>
<p>
The standard basis vectors in two dimensions are
<me>
\hi = \llt 1,0\rgt \qquad\qquad\hj =\llt 0,1\rgt
</me>
</p>
<sidebyside width="15%">
  <image source="figs/basis2d"/>

<p>
The standard basis vectors in three dimensions are

</me>
</p>
<sidebyside width="25%">

</sidebyside>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
We'll explain the little hats in the notation <m>\hi</m>, <m>\hj</m>, <m>\hk</m> shortly.
Some people rename <m>\hi</m>, <m>\hj</m> and <m>\hk</m> to <m>\he_1</m>, <m>\he_2</m> and
<m>\he_3</m> respectively.
Using the above properties we have, for all vectors,
<me>
\llt a_1,a_2\rgt =a_1\,\hi+a_2\,\hj\qquad\qquad
\llt a_1,a_2,a_3\rgt =a_1\,\hi+a_2\,\hj+a_3\,\hk
</me>
A sum of numbers times vectors, like <m>a_1\hi+a_2\hj</m> is called
a linear combination of the vectors.
Thus all vectors can be expressed as linear combinations of the standard
basis vectors. This makes basis vectors very helpful in computations.
The  standard basis vectors are unit vectors, meaning that they are of
length one, where the length of a vector <m>\va</m> is denoted<fn>The notation <m>\|\va\|</m> is also used for the length of <m>\va</m>.</fn>
 <m>|\va|</m>

A unit vector is a vector of length one. We'll sometimes use the accent
<m>\hat{\ }</m> to emphasise that the vector <m>\hat\va</m> is a unit vector.
That is, <m>|\hat\va|=1</m>.
</p></statement>
</definition>


<example xml:id="eg_unit_vector">
<p>
Recall that multiplying a vector <m>\va</m> by a positive number <m>s</m>,
changes the length of the vector by a factor <m>s</m> without changing
the direction of the vector. So (assuming that <m>|\va|\ne 0)</m>
<m>\frac{\va}{|\va|}</m> is a unit vector that has the same direction as
<m>\va</m>. For example, <m>\frac{\llt 1,1,1\rgt}{\sqrt{3}}</m> is a unit vector
that points in the same direction as <m>\llt 1,1,1\rgt</m>.
</p>
</example>


<example xml:id="eg_walk">
<p>
We go for a walk on a flat Earth. We use a coordinate system
with the positive x-axis pointing due east and the positive y-axis pointing due
north. We
<ul>
<li>
start at the origin and
</li>
<li>
walk due east for 4 units and then
</li>
<li>
walk northeast for <m>5\sqrt{2}</m> units and then
</li>
<li>
head towards the point <m>(0,11)</m>, but we only go
</li>

one third of the way.

<p>
We will now use vectors to figure out our final location.
<ul>
<li>
On the first leg of our walk, we go 4 units in the positive <m>x</m>-direction.
So our displacement vector <mdash/> the vector whose tail is at our starting point and whose head is at the end point of the first leg <mdash/> is <m>\llt 4,0\rgt</m>.
As we started at <m>(0,0)</m> we finish the first leg of the walk at <m>(4,0)</m>.
</li>
<li>
On the second leg of our walk, our direction of motion is northeast, i.e. is
<m>45^\circ</m> above the direction of the positive <m>x</m>-axis. Looking at the figure
on the right above, we see that our displacement vector, for the second leg of the walk, has to be in the same direction as the vector <m>\llt 1,1\rgt</m>.
So our displacement vector is the vector of length <m>5\sqrt{2}</m> with the same direction as <m>\llt 1,1\rgt</m>. The vector <m>\llt 1,1\rgt</m> has length
<m>\sqrt{1^2+1^2}=\sqrt{2}</m> and so <m>\frac{\llt 1,1\rgt}{\sqrt{2}}</m> has length one
and our displacement vector is
<me>
5\sqrt{2}\ \frac{\llt 1,1\rgt}{\sqrt{2}}
=5 \llt 1,1\rgt
=\llt 5,5\rgt
</me>
If we draw this displacement vector, <m>\llt 5,5\rgt</m> with its tail at
<m>(4,0)</m>, the starting point of the second leg of the walk, then its head
will be at <m>(4+5, 0+5)=(9,5)</m> and that is the end point of the second
leg of the walk.
</li>
<li>
On the final leg of our walk, we start at <m>(9,5)</m> and walk towards <m>(0,11)</m>.
The vector from <m>(9,5)</m> to <m>(0,11)</m> is <m>\llt 0-9\,,\,11-5\rgt =\llt -9,6\rgt</m>.
As we go only one third of the way, our final displacement vector is
<me>
\frac{1}{3}\llt -9,6\rgt
=\llt -3,2\rgt
</me>
If we draw this displacement vector with its tail at
<m>(9,5)</m>, the starting point of the final leg, then its head
will be at <m>(9-3, 5+2)=(6,7)</m> and that is the end point of the final
leg of the walk, and our final location.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-dotprod">
  <title>The Dot Product</title>

<p>Let's get back to the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication.
We will be using both scalars and vectors. So, for each operation there are
three possibilities that we need to explore:
<ul>
<li> <q>scalar plus scalar</q>, <q>scalar plus vector</q> and <q>vector plus vector</q>
</li>
<li><q>scalar times scalar</q>, <q>scalar times vector</q> and
         <q>vector times vector</q>
</li>
</ul>
We have been using <q>scalar plus scalar</q> and <q>scalar times scalar</q>
since childhood. <q>vector plus vector</q> and <q>scalar times vector</q>
were just defined above. There is no sensible way to define <q>scalar plus vector</q>, so we won't. This leaves <q>vector times vector</q>.
There are actually two widely used such products.
The first is the <em>dot product</em>, which is the topic of this section,
and which is used to easily determine the angle <m>\theta</m> (or more precisely,
<m>\cos\theta</m>) between two vectors.
We'll get to the second, the cross product, later.
</p>

<p>
Here is preview of what we will do in this dot product 
subsection &#xA7;<xref ref="subsec-dotprod"/>. We are going to give two formulae
for the dot product, <m>\va\cdot\vb</m>, of the pair of vectors 
<m>\va=\llt a_1,a_2,a_3\rgt</m> and <m>\vb=\llt b_1,b_2,b_3\rgt</m>.
<ul>
<li> 
The first formula is <m>\va\cdot\vb = a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3</m>.
We will take it as our official definition of <m>\va\cdot\vb</m>.
This formula provides us with an easy way to compute dot products.
</li><li>
<p>
The second formula is <m>\va\cdot\vb=|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta</m>, 
        where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m>.
</p>
    <sidebyside width="15.3%">
     <image source="figs/dotAngle"/>
     </sidebyside>
<p>
We will show, in Theorem <xref ref="thm_dotPppties"/> below, that this second formula always gives the same answer as the first formula.
The second formula provides us with an easy way to determine the angle between two vectors. In particular, it provides us with an easy way to test whether or not two vectors are perpendicular to each other. For example,
the vectors <m>\llt 1,2,3\rgt</m> and <m>\llt -1,-1,1\rgt</m> have dot product
<me>
\llt 1,2,3\rgt\cdot\llt -1,-1,1\rgt = 1\times(-1)+2\times(-1)+3\times 1=0
</me>
This tell us as the angle <m>\theta</m> between the two vectors obeys 
<m>\cos\theta=0</m>, so that <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>. That is, the two vectors are perpendicular to each other.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
After we give our official definition of the dot product in
Definition <xref ref="def_dotProd"/>, and give the important properties of the dot product, including the formula  <m>\va\cdot\vb=|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta</m>,
in Theorem <xref ref="thm_dotPppties"/>, we'll give some examples.
Finally, to see the dot product in action, we'll define what it means to 
project one vector on another vector and give an example.

  Property 6 is sufficiently important that it is often used as the
definition of dot product. It is not at all an obvious consequence of the definition.
To verify it, we just write <m>|\va-\vb|^2</m> in two different ways.
The first expresses <m>|\va-\vb|^2</m> in terms of <m>\va\cdot\vb</m>.
It is
<md>
<mrow>
|\va-\vb|^2\ &amp;{\buildrel 1 \over =}\ (\va-\vb\,)\cdot(\va-\vb\,)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;{\buildrel 3 \over =}\ \va\cdot\va-\va\cdot\vb-\vb\cdot\va
+\vb\cdot\vb
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;{\buildrel 1,2 \over =}\ |\va|^2+|\vb|^2-2\va\cdot\vb
</mrow>
</md>
Here, <m>{\buildrel 1 \over =}</m>, for
example, means that the equality is  a consequence of property 1.
The second way we write <m>|\va-\vb|^2</m> involves <m>\cos\theta</m> and follows from
the cosine law for triangles. Just in case you don't remember the
cosine law, we'll derive it right now! Start by applying Pythagoras to the
shaded triangle in the right hand figure of
</p>

<sidebyside width="85%">
  <image source="figs/cosineB"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
That triangle is a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length <m>|\va-\vb|</m>
and  whose other two sides have lengths <m>\big(|\vb|-|\va|\cos\theta\big)</m>
and <m>|\va|\sin\theta</m>. So Pythagoras gives
<md>
<mrow>
|\va-\vb|^2&amp;=\big(|\vb|-|\va|\cos\theta\big)^2+
\big(|\va|\sin\theta\big)^2
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=|\vb|^2-2|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta+|\va|^2\cos^2\theta
+|\va|^2\sin^2\theta
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=|\vb|^2-2|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta+|\va|^2
</mrow>
</md>
This is precisely the cosine law<fn>
  You may be used to seeing it written as <m>c^2=a^2+b^2-2 a b \cos C</m>, where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle and <m>C</m> is the angle opposite the side of length <m>c</m>
</fn>.
Observe that, when <m>\theta=\tfrac{\pi}{2}</m>,
this reduces to, (surprise!) Pythagoras' theorem.
</p>

<p>
  Setting our two expressions for <m>|\va-\vb|^2</m> equal to each other,
<md>
<mrow>
|\va-\vb|^2=|\va|^2+|\vb|^2-2\va\cdot\vb
=|\vb|^2-2|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta+|\va|^2
</mrow>
</md>
cancelling the <m>|\va|^2</m> and <m>|\vb|^2</m> common to both sides
<md>
<mrow>
-2\va\cdot\vb
=-2|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta
</mrow>
</md>
and dividing by <m>-2</m> gives
<md>
<mrow>
\va\cdot\vb=|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta
</mrow>
</md>
which is exactly property 6.
</p>


<p>Property 7 follows directly from property 6. First note that the dot product <m>\va\cdot\vb=|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta</m>
is zero if and only if at least one of the three factors
<m>|\va|,\ |\vb|,\ \cos\theta</m> is zero. The first factor is zero if
and only if <m>\va=\vZero </m>. The second factor is zero if and only if
<m>\vb=\vZero </m>.
The third factor is zero if and only if <m>\theta=\pm\tfrac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi</m>,
for some integer <m>k</m>, which in turn is true if and only if <m>\va</m> and
<m>\vb</m> are mutually perpendicular.
</p>
</proof>


<p>
Because of Property 7 of Theorem <xref ref="thm_dotPppties"/>, the dot product
can be used to test whether or not two vectors are perpendicular to
each other. That is, whether or not the angle between the two vectors
is <m>90^\circ</m>. Another name<fn>The concepts of the dot product
and perpendicularity have been generalized a lot in mathematics (for example,
from 2d and 3d vectors to functions). The generalization of the dot
product is called the <q>inner product</q> and the generalization
of perpendicularity is called <q>orthogonality</q>.</fn>
 for <q>perpendicular</q>
is <q>orthogonal</q>. Testing for orthogonality is one of the main uses of the
dot product.

  Dot products are also used to compute projections.  First, here's
the definition.

<p>
Think of the projection of <m>\va</m> on <m>\vb</m> as the part of <m>\va</m> that is in the
direction of <m>\vb</m>.
</p>

<p>
  Now let's develop a formula for the projection of <m>\va</m> on <m>\vb</m>.
Denote by <m>\theta</m> the angle between <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m>. If <m>|\theta|</m> is no
more than <m>90^\circ</m>, as in the figure on the left above,
the length of the projection of <m>\va</m> on <m>\vb</m> is
<m>|\va|\cos\theta</m>.
By Property 6 of Theorem <xref ref="thm_dotPppties"/>,
<m>|\va|\cos\theta=\va\cdot\vb/|\vb|</m>, so the
projection is a vector whose length is <m>\va\cdot\vb/|\vb|</m> and
whose direction is given by the unit vector <m>\vb/|\vb|</m>. Hence
<md>
<mrow>
\text{projection of \(\va\) on \(\vb\)}={\rm proj}_{\vb}\,\va

</md>
If <m>|\theta|</m> is larger than <m>90^\circ</m>, as in the figure on the right above, the projection has length
<m>|\va|\,\cos(\pi-\theta)=-|\va|\cos\theta=-\va\cdot\vb/|\vb|</m>
 and direction <m>-\vb/|\vb|</m>. In this case

This is a rather complicated looking equation. Writing out its <m>x</m>- and
<m>y</m>-components doesn't help. They also look complicated.
Instead, the equation can be considerably simplified (and
consequently better understood) by <q>taking its components parallel to
and perpendicular to the direction of motion</q>. From the velocity vector
<m>\vv(t)</m>, we see that <m>\llt \cos\theta(t),\sin\theta(t)\rgt </m> is a unit
vector parallel to the direction of motion at time <m>t</m>.
Recall, from <xref ref="eqn_unit_proj"/>, that the projection of any vector

The coefficient <m>\vb\cdot \hat\vd</m> is, by definition, the

So, by dotting both sides of the equation of motion <m>(*)</m> with

parallel to the direction of motion. Since

When <m>\theta</m> is small, we can approximate <m>\sin\theta\approx\theta</m>
and get the equation
<md>
<mrow>
\ddiff{2}{\theta}{t}+\frac{\beta}{m}\diff{\theta}{t}+\frac{g}{\ell}\theta=0

</md>
which is easily solved. There are systematic procedures for finding
the solution, but we'll just guess.
</p>

<p>
  When there is no friction (so that <m>\beta=0</m>), we would expect the pendulum to just oscillate. So it is natural to guess
<me>
\theta(t)=A\sin(\omega t-\delta)
</me>
which is an oscillation with (unknown) amplitude <m>A</m>, frequency <m>\omega</m> (radians per unit time) and phase <m>\delta</m>.
Substituting this guess into the left hand side,
<m>\theta''  + \tfrac{g}{\ell}\theta</m>,  yields
<me>
-A\omega^2\sin(\omega t-\delta)+A\tfrac{g}{\ell}\sin(\omega t-\delta)
</me>
which is zero if <m>\omega=\sqrt{g/\ell}</m>.
So <m>\ \theta(t)=A\sin(\omega t-\delta)\ </m> is a solution for any amplitude <m>A</m> and phase <m>\delta</m>, provided the frequency <m>\omega=\sqrt{g/\ell}</m>.
</p>


<p>
  When there is some, but not too much, friction, so that <m>\beta \gt 0</m> is
relatively small, we would expect <q>oscillation with decaying amplitude</q>.
So we  guess
<me>
\theta(t)=Ae^{-\gamma t}\sin(\omega t-\delta)

for some constant decay rate <m>\gamma</m>, to be determined.

When there is a lot of friction
(namely when <m>\tfrac{\beta^2}{4m^2} \gt \tfrac{g}{\ell}</m>, so that the frequency

from the large rectangle by deleting the two small rectangles (each of
area <m>bc</m>), and the two lightly shaded triangles (each of area <m>\half cd</m>),
and the two darkly shaded triangles (each of area <m>\half ab</m>). So the desired

<m>\llt c,d\rgt </m> lies above <m>\llt a,b\rgt </m>.
By simply interchanging <m>a\leftrightarrow c</m> and <m>b\leftrightarrow d</m>
in the picture and throughout the argument, we see that when
<m>a,\ b,\ c,\ d\ge 0</m> and <m>b/a\ge d/c</m>, so that the vector <m>\llt c,d\rgt </m>
lies below <m>\llt a,b\rgt </m>, the area of the parallelogram is <m>bc-ad</m>.

is (up to a sign) the height of the parallelepiped. The second factor is,
up to a sign, the area of the parallelogram determined by <m>\vb</m>

The product is indeed, up to a sign, the volume of the parallelepiped.
That the formula is true in general is a consequence of the fact (that
we will not prove) that the value of a determinant does not change when
one rotates the coordinate system and that one can always rotate
our coordinate axes around so that <m>\vb</m> and <m>\vc</m> both lie in the

  <title>The Cross Product</title>


<p>We have already seen two different products involving vectors <mdash/>
the multiplication of a vector by a scalar
and the dot product of two vectors. The dot product of two vectors
yields a scalar. We now introduce another product
of two vectors, called the <em>cross product</em>. The cross product of
two vectors will give a vector. There are applications which have two
vectors as inputs and produce one vector as an output, and which are related
to the cross product. Here is a very brief mention of two such applications.
We will look at them in much more detail later.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Consider a parallelogram in three dimensions.
A parallelogram is naturally determined by the two vectors that define
its sides.
One measure of the size of a parallelogram is its area.
One way to specify the orientation of the parallelogram is to give a vector
that is perpendicular to it.
A very compact way to encode both the area and the orientation of
the parallelogram is to give a vector whose direction is perpendicular
to the plane in which it lies and whose magnitude is its area.
We shall see that such a vector can be easily constructed by taking the cross product (definition coming shortly) of the two vectors that give
the sides of the parallelogram.
</p>

<sidebyside width="35%">
<image source="figs/pgramCross"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Imagine a rigid body which is rotating at a rate <m>\Omega</m> radians per
second about an axis whose direction is given by the unit vector <m>\hat\va</m>.
Let <m>P</m> be any point on the body. We shall see, in the (optional)
§<xref ref="sec_rot_motion"/>, that the velocity, <m>\vv</m>, of the point <m>P</m>
is the cross product
(again, definition coming shortly) of the vector <m>\Om\hat\va</m> with the vector
<m>\vr</m> from any point on the axis of rotation to <m>P</m>.
</p>
<sidebyside width="33%">
<image source="figs/rigidBB"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Finally, here is the definition of the cross product. Note that it applies only to vectors in three dimensions.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def_crossProd"><title>Cross Product</title>
<statement><p>
The cross product of the vectors <m>\va=\llt a_1,a_2,a_3\rgt</m> and
<m>\vb=\llt b_1,b_2,b_3\rgt</m> is denoted <m>\va\times\vb</m>
and is defined by
<md>
<mrow>
\va\times\vb = \llt a_2b_3-a_3b_2\,,\, a_3b_1-a_1b_3\,,\, a_1b_2-a_2b_1\rgt
</mrow>
</md>
</p></statement>
</definition>


<p>Note that each component has the form <m>a_ib_j-a_jb_i</m>. The index <m>i</m> of
the first <m>a</m> in component number <m>k</m> of <m>\va\times\vb</m>
is just after <m>k</m> in the list <m>1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,\cdots</m>.
The index <m>j</m> of the first <m>b</m> is just before <m>k</m> in the list.
<md>
<mrow>
(\va\times\vb)_k
=a_{{\rm just\  after\  }k}\ b_{{\rm just\  before\  }k}
-a_{{\rm just\  before\  }k}\ b_{{\rm just\  after\  }k}
</mrow>
</md>
For example, for component number <m>k=3</m>,
<md>
<mrow>
\left.{\text{''just after 3'' is 1}}\atop{\text{''just before 3'' is 2}}\right\}
\implies (\va\times\vb)_3= a_1b_2-a_2b_1
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
There is a much better way to remember this definition. Recall that
a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix is an array of numbers having two rows and two columns
and that the determinant of a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix is  defined by
<md>
<mrow>
\det \left[\begin{matrix}a&amp; b \\ c&amp;d\end{matrix}\right]=ad-bc
</mrow>
</md>
It is the product of the entries on the diagonal minus the product
of the entries not on the diagonal.
</p>


<p>
  A <m>3\times 3</m> matrix is an array of numbers having three rows and three columns.
<md>
<mrow>
 \left[\begin{matrix}
i&amp; j &amp;k
\\
a_1&amp;a_2&amp;a_3
\\
b_1&amp;b_2&amp;b_3\end{matrix}\right]
</mrow>
</md>
You will shortly see why the entries in the top row have been given the
rather peculiar names <m>i</m>, <m>j</m> and <m>k</m>. The determinant of a <m>3\times 3</m>
matrix can be defined in terms of some <m>2\times 2</m> determinants by
</p>
<sidebyside width="95%">
  <image source="figs/det"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
This formula is called <q>expansion of the determinant along the top row</q>.
There is one term in the formula for each entry in the top row. The term is
a sign times the entry itself times the determinant of the <m>2\times 2</m> matrix
gotten by deleting the row and column that contains the entry.
The sign alternates, starting with a <m>+</m>. If we now replace <m>i</m> by <m>\hi</m>, <m>j</m> by <m>\hj</m> and <m>k</m> by <m>\hk</m>, we get exactly the formula for <m>\va\times \vb</m>
of Definition <xref ref="def_crossProd"/>. That is the reason for the peculiar
choice of names for the matrix entries. So
<md>
<mrow>
\va\times\vb
&amp;=\det\left[\begin{matrix}\hi&amp; \hj &amp;\hk
\\
a_1&amp;a_2&amp;a_3
\\

</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\hi\big(a_2b_3-a_3b_2) -\hj(a_1b_3-a_3b_1) +\hk(a_1b_2-a_2b_1)
</mrow>
</md>
is a mnemonic device for remembering the definition of <m>\va\times\vb</m>.
It is also good from the point of view of evaluating <m>\va\times\vb</m>. Here are several examples in which we use the determinant mnemonic device to evaluate cross products.
</p>

</p>
<sidebyside width="95%">

</sidebyside>
<p>
Note that, unlike most (or maybe even all) products that you have seen before, <m>\hi\times\hj</m> is <em>not</em> the same as <m>\hj\times\hi</m>!
</p>
</example>


<example xml:id="eg_GEOcrossEgA">

Here are some important observations.
<ul>
<li> 
The vectors <m>\va\times\vb</m> and <m>\vb\times\va</m> are not the same! In fact
    <m>\vb\times\va=-\va\times\vb</m>. We shall see in Theorem <xref ref="thm_crossPppties"/> below that this was not a fluke.

</li><li>
The vector <m>\va\times\vb</m> has dot product zero with both <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m>.
So the vector  <m>\va\times\vb</m> is prependicular to both <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m>. 
We shall see in Theorem <xref ref="thm_crossPppties"/> below that this was also not a fluke.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</example>


<example xml:id="eg_GEOcrossEgB">
<p>
Yet again we use the mnemonic device to compute a more complicated cross product. This time let <m>\va=\llt 3,2,1 \rgt</m> and <m>\vb=\llt 6,4,2 \rgt</m>. Then
</p>
<sidebyside width="95%">

</sidebyside>
<p>
We shall see in Theorem <xref ref="thm_crossPppties"/>
    below that it is not a fluke that the cross product is <m>\vZero</m>.
It is a consequence of the fact that <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb=2\va</m> are parallel.
</p>
</example>


<p>
We now move on to learning about the properties of the cross product.
  Our first properties lead up to a more intuitive geometric definition of <m>\va\times\vb</m>, which is better for interpreting <m>\va\times\vb</m>.
 These properties of the cross product, which state that  <m>\va\times\vb</m>
is a vector and then determine its direction and length, are as follows.
We will collect these properties, and a few others, into a theorem shortly.

To see that <m>|\va|\,|\vb|\sin\theta</m> is the area of the parallelogram
with sides <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m>, just recall that the area of any parallelogram
is given by the length of its base times its height. Think of <m>\va</m> as the
base of the parallelogram. Then <m>|\va|</m> is the length of the base
and <m>|\vb|\sin\theta</m> is the height.

These properties almost determine <m>\va\times\vb</m>.
Property 1 forces the vector <m>\va\times\vb</m> to lie on the line perpendicular to the
plane containing <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m>.
There are precisely two vectors on this line that have the length given by property 2.

which says that if you form your right hand into a fist with your fingers curling from
<m>\va</m> to <m>\vb</m>, then when you stick your thumb straight out from
the fist, it points in the direction of <m>\va\times\vb</m>. This is

</p>

<proof><title>Outline of Proof</title>
<p>
  We have already seen that the right hand side has the correct length and, except possibly for a sign, direction. To check that the right hand rule holds in general, rotate your coordinate system around<fn>
  Note that as you translate or rotate the coordinate system, the right hand rule is preserved.
  If <m>(\va,\vb,\hn)</m> obey the right hand rule so do their rotated and translated versions.
</fn>
so that <m>\va</m> points along the positive <m>x</m> axis and <m>\vb</m> lies in the <m>xy</m>-plane with positive <m>y</m> component.
That is <m>\va=\alpha\hi</m> and <m>\vb=\beta\hi+\gamma\hj</m> with <m>\alpha,\gamma\ge 0</m>.
Then
<me>\va\times\vb=\alpha\hi\times(\beta\hi+\gamma\hj) =\alpha\beta\,\hi\times\hi+\alpha\gamma\,\hi\times\hj.
</me>
The first term vanishes by property 2, because the angle <m>\theta</m> between <m>\hi</m>
and <m>\hi</m> is zero.
So, by property 3, <m>\va\times\vb= \alpha\gamma\hk</m> points along the positive <m>z</m> axis, which is consistent with the right hand rule.
</p>
</proof>


<p>
  The analog of property 7 of the dot product (which says that <m>\va\cdot\vb</m> is zero if and only if  <m>\va=\vZero</m> or <m>\vb=\vZero</m> or  <m>\va\perp\vb</m>) follows immediately from property 2.

The remaining properties are all tools for

As an illustration of the properties of the dot and cross product, we now

The volume of the parallelepiped is the area of its base times its
height<fn>
  This is a simple integral calculus exercise.
</fn>.
The base is the parallelogram with sides <m>\vb</m> and
<m>\vc</m>. Its area is the length of its base, which is <m>|\vb|</m>,
times its height, which is <m>|\vc|\,\sin\theta</m>. (Drop a
perpendicular from the head of <m>\vc</m> to the line containing <m>\vb</m>).
Here <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\vb</m> and <m>\vc</m>. So the area of the
base is <m>|\vb|\,|\vc|\,\sin\theta= |\vb\times\vc|</m>, by
property 2 of the cross product.
</p>
<p>
To get the height of the parallelepiped,
we drop a perpendicular from the head of <m>\va</m> to the line that passes
through the tail of <m>\va</m> and is perpendicular to the base of the parallelepiped. In other words, from the head of <m>\va</m> to the line that contains both the head and the tail
of <m>\vb\times\vc</m>. So the height of the parallelepiped is
<m>|\va|\,|\cos\varphi|</m>.  (The absolute values have been included because
if the angle between <m>\vb\times\vc</m> and <m>\va</m> happens to be greater

  <title>(Optional) Application of Cross Products to Rotational Motion</title>

<p>
  In most computations involving rotational motion, the cross product shows
up in one form or another. This is one of the main applications of the cross
product. Consider, for example, a rigid body which is rotating
 at a constant rate of <m>\Omega</m> radians per second about an axis
whose direction is given by the unit vector <m>\hat\va</m>. Let <m>P</m> be any point
on the body. Let's figure out its velocity. Pick any point on the axis
of rotation and designate it as the origin of our coordinate system. Denote
by <m>\vr</m> the vector from the origin to the point <m>P</m>. Let <m>\theta</m> denote
the angle between <m>\hat\va</m> and <m>\vr</m>. As time progresses the point <m>P</m>
sweeps out a circle of radius <m>R=|\vr\,|\sin\theta</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="33%">
<image source="figs/rigid"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
In one second <m>P</m> travels along an arc that subtends an angle of
<m>\Omega</m> radians, which is the fraction <m>\tfrac{\Omega}{2\pi}</m>
of a full circle.  The length of this arc is
<m>\tfrac{\Omega}{2\pi}\times 2\pi R=\Omega R=\Omega|\vr\,|\sin\theta</m> so <m>P</m> travels the distance <m>\Omega|\vr\,|\sin\theta</m>
in one second and its speed, which is also the length of its velocity vector,
is <m>\Omega|\vr\,|\sin\theta</m>.
</p>

<p>Now we just need to figure out the direction
of the velocity vector. That is, the direction of motion of the point <m>P</m>.
Imagine that both <m>\hat\va</m> and <m>\vr</m> lie in the plane of a piece of paper,
as in the figure above. Then <m>\vv</m> points either straight into
or straight out of the page and consequently is perpendicular
to both <m>\hat\va</m> and <m>\vr</m>. To distinguish between the <q>into the page</q>
and <q>out of the page</q> cases, let's impose the conventions that
<m>\Omega \gt 0</m> and the axis of rotation <m>\hat\va</m> is chosen to obey the right hand
 rule, meaning that if the thumb of
your right hand is pointing in the direction <m>\hat\va</m>, then your fingers
are pointing in the direction of motion of the rigid body.  Under these
conventions, the velocity vector <m>\vv</m> obeys
<ul>
<li> <m>|\vv|=\Omega|\vr||\hat\va|\sin\theta</m>
</li>
<li> <m>\vv\perp\hat\va,\vr</m>
</li>
<li> <m>(\hat\va,\vr,\vv)</m> obey the right hand rule
</li>
</ul>
That is, <m>\vv</m> is exactly <m>\Omega\hat\va\times\vr</m>. It is conventional
to define the <q>angular velocity</q> of a rigid body to be vector
<m>\mathbf{\Omega}=\Omega\hat\va</m>. That is, the vector with length given
by the rate of rotation and direction given by the axis of rotation
of the rigid body. In particular, the bigger the rate of rotation, the longer
the angular velocity vector. In terms of this angular
velocity vector, the velocity of the point <m>P</m> is

Differentiating a second time, the acceleration of the moving particle

Recall that the angular velocity <m>\vOmega=(0,0,\Omega)</m> does
not depend on time.
The rotating observer sees <m>\hi(t)</m> as <m>\hi=(1,0,0)</m>,
sees <m>\hj(t)</m> as <m>\hj=(0,1,0)</m>, and sees <m>\hk(t)</m> as <m>\hk=(0,0,1)</m> and so sees

\frac{\vF}{m}

where, as usual,

\vv(t) &amp;= \diff{}{t}\vr(t)

So the acceleration of the particle seen by the moving observer is
<md>
<mrow>
\va(t) = \frac{\vF}{m} -  2\vOmega\times\vv(t)
                     - \vOmega\times\big[\vOmega\times\vr(t)\big]

</md>
Here
<ul>
<li>
   <m>\vF</m> is the sum of all external forces acting on the moving particle,
</li>
<li>
   <m>\vF_{{\rm cor}}=-2 \vOmega\times\vv(t)</m> is called the Coriolis force and
</li>
<li>
   <m> - \vOmega\times\big[\vOmega\times\vr(t)\big]</m> is called the centrifugal force.
</li>
</ul>
As an example, suppose that you are the moving particle and that
you are at the edge of the merry-go-round. Let's say <m>t=0</m> and you are
at <m>\hi</m>. Then <m>\vF</m> is the friction that the surface of the merry-go-round
applies to the soles of your shoes. If you are just standing there,
<m>\vv(t)=\vZero</m>, so that <m>\vF_{{\rm cor}}=\vZero</m>, and the friction
<m>\vF</m> exactly cancels the centrifugal force
<m>-\vOmega\times\big[\vOmega\times\vr(t)\big]</m>
so that you remain at <m>\hi(t)</m>. Assume that <m>\Om \gt 0</m>. Now suppose that
you start walking around the edge of the merry-go-round. Then,
at <m>t=0</m>, <m>\vr=\hi</m> and
<ul>
<li>
   if you walk in the direction of rotation (with speed one), as in the figure on the
   left below, <m>\vv=\hj</m> and the Coriolis force <m>\vF_{{\rm cor}}=
   -2\Om\hk\times\hj = 2\Om\,\hi</m> tries to push you off of
   the merry-go-round, while
</li>
<li>
   if you walk opposite to the direction of rotation (with speed one), as in the figure
   on the right below,  <m>\vv=-\hj</m> so that the Coriolis force
   <m>\vF_{{\rm cor}}=-2\Om\hk\times(-\hj) = -2\Om\,\hi</m> tries to pull you
   into the centre of the merry-go-round.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
  On a rotating ball, such as the Earth, the Coriolis force deflects
wind to the right (counterclockwise) in the northern hemisphere
and to the left (clockwise) is the southern hemisphere. In particular,
hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons rotate counterclockwise in the northern
hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. On the other
hand, when it comes to water draining out of, for example, a toilet,
Coriolis force effects are dominated by other factors like asymmetry
of the toilet.

    Specifying one point <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> on a plane and a vector <m>\vd</m> parallel
  to the plane does not uniquely determine the plane, because it is free
  to rotate about <m>\vd</m>. On the other hand, giving one point

  on the plane and one vector <m>\vn=\llt n_x,n_y, n_z\rgt </m> with direction
  perpendicular to that of the plane does uniquely determine the plane.
  If <m>(x,y,z)</m> is any point on the line then the vector
  <m>\llt x-x_0,y-y_0,z-z_0\rgt </m>,
  whose tail is at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> and whose head is at <m>(x,y,z)</m>,  lies
  entirely inside the plane and so must be perpendicular to <m>\vn</m>. That is,

<p>
  Again, the coefficients <m>n_x,n_y,n_z</m> of <m>x,\ y</m> and <m>z</m> in the equation
  of the plane are the components of a vector <m>\llt n_x,n_y,n_z\rgt </m>
  perpendicular to the plane. The vector <m>\vn</m> is often called a normal vector
  for the plane. Any nonzero multiple of <m>\vn</m> will also be perpendicular
  to the plane and is also called a normal vector.
</p>


<example xml:id="eg_VPparallel-normal-Planes">
  <p>
  We have just seen that if we write the equation of a plane in the standard
  form
  <me>
  ax+by+cz=d
  </me>
  then it is easy to read off a normal vector for the plane.
  It is just <m>\llt a,b,c\rgt</m>. So for example the planes
  <me>
  P:\ x+2y+3z=4 \qquad
  P':\ 3x+6y+9z=7
  </me>
  have normal vectors <m>\vn=\llt 1,2,3\rgt</m> and <m>\vn'=\llt 3,6,9\rgt</m>,
  respectively. Since <m>\vn'=3\vn</m>, the two normal vectors <m>\vn</m> and <m>\vn'</m>
  are parallel to each other. This tells us that the planes <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m>
  are parallel to each other.
  </p>

  <p>When the normal vectors of two planes are perpendicular to each other,
  we say that
  the planes are perpendicular to each other. For example
  the planes
  <me>
  P:\ x+2y+3z=4 \qquad
  P':\ 2x-y=7
  </me>
  have normal vectors  <m>\vn=\llt 1,2,3\rgt</m> and <m>\vn'=\llt 2,-1,0\rgt</m>,
  respectively. Since
  <me>
  \vn\cdot\vn' = 1\times 2+2\times(-1)+3\times 0 = 0
  </me>
  the normal vectors <m>\vn</m> and <m>\vn'</m> are mutually perpendicular,
  so the corresponding planes <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m> are perpendicular to each other.
  </p>
</example>


<example xml:id="eg_VPsketchPlane">
  <p>
  In this example, we'll sketch the plane
  <me>
  P:\ 4x + 3y + 2z = 12
  </me>
  A good way to prepare for sketching a plane is to find the intersection
  points of the plane with the <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-axes, just as you are used
  to doing when sketching lines in the <m>xy</m>-plane. For example,
  any point on the <m>x</m> axis must be of the form <m>(x,0,0)</m>. For <m>(x,0,0)</m>
  to also be on <m>P</m> we need <m>x=\frac{12}{4}=3</m>. So <m>P</m> intersects
  the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>(3,0,0)</m>. Similarly, <m>P</m> intersects the <m>y</m>-axis
  at <m>(0,4,0)</m> and the <m>z</m>-axis at <m>(0,0,6)</m>. Now plot the points
  <m>(3,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,4,0)</m> and <m>(0,0,6)</m>. <m>P</m> is the plane containing these
  three points.
  Often a visually effective way to sketch a surface in three dimensions
  is to
  <ul>
  <li> only sketch the part of the surface in the first octant. That is,
  the part with <m>x\ge0</m>, <m>y\ge 0</m> and <m>z\ge 0</m>.
  </li>
  <li> To do so, sketch the curve of intersection of the surface with
  the part of the <m>xy</m>-plane in the first octant and,
  </li>
  <li> similarly, sketch the curve of intersection of the surface with
  the part of the <m>xz</m>-plane in the first octant and
  the curve of intersection of the surface with
  the part of the <m>yz</m>-plane in the first octant.
  </li>
  </ul>
  That's what we'll do. The intersection of the plane <m>P</m> with the <m>xy</m>-plane
  is the straight line through the two points <m>(3,0,0)</m> and <m>(0,4,0)</m>. So
  the part of that intersection in the first octant is the line segment
  from <m>(3,0,0)</m> to <m>(0,4,0)</m>. Similarly the part of the intersection of
  <m>P</m> with the <m>xz</m>-plane that is in the first octant is the line segment
  from <m>(3,0,0)</m> to <m>(0,0,6)</m> and  the part of the intersection of
  <m>P</m> with the <m>yz</m>-plane that is in the first octant is the line segment
  from <m>(0,4,0)</m> to <m>(0,0,6)</m>. So we just have to sketch the three line segments
  joining three axis intercepts <m>(3,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,4,0)</m> and <m>(0,0,6)</m>.
  That's it.

<example xml:id="eg_VPdistance-point-plane">
  <p>
  In this example, we'll compute the distance between the point
  <me>
  \vx = (1,-1,-3) \qquad\text{and the plane}\qquad
  P:\ x+2y+3z=18
  </me>
  By the <q>distance between <m>\vx</m> and the plane <m>P</m></q> we mean the shortest
  distance between <m>\vx</m> and any point <m>\vy</m> on <m>P</m>. In fact, we'll evaluate the
  distance in two different ways. In the next
  Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-point-plane-bis"/>, we'll use projection.
  In this example, our strategy for finding the distance will be to
  <ul>
  <li> first observe that the vector <m>\vn=\llt 1,2,3\rgt</m> is normal to <m>P</m>
  and then
  </li>
  <li> start walking<fn>To see why heading in the normal direction gives
  the shortest walk, revisit Example <xref ref="eg_nearest_point"/>.</fn>
   away from <m>\vx</m>
  in the  direction of the normal vector <m>\vn</m> and
  </li>
  <li> keep walking until we hit <m>P</m>. Call the point on <m>P</m> where we hit,
  <m>\vy</m>. Then the desired distance is the distance between <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m>.
  From the figure below it does indeed look like distance between <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m>
  is the shortest distance between <m>\vx</m> and any point on <m>P</m>. This is in
  fact true, though we won't prove it.
  </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<sidebyside width="45%">
<image source="figs/pointDist.svg"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
  So imagine that we start walking, and that we start at time <m>t=0</m> at <m>\vx</m>
  and walk in the direction <m>\vn</m>. Then at time <m>t</m> we might be at
  <me>
  \vx+t\vn = (1,-1,-3) +t\,\llt 1,2,3\rgt
           = (1+t, -1+2t, -3+3t)
  </me>
  We hit the plane <m>P</m> at exactly the time <m>t</m> for which
  <m>(1+t, -1+2t, -3+3t)</m> satisfies the equation for <m>P</m>, which is
  <m>x+2y+3z=18</m>. So we are on <m>P</m> at the unique time <m>t</m> obeying

  <mrow>
  (1+t)+2(-1+2t)+3(-3+3t)=18
  &amp;\iff 14t = 28
  \iff t=2

  </md>
  So the point on <m>P</m> which is closest to <m>\vx</m> is
  <md>
  <mrow>
  \vy = \big[\vx+t\vn\big]_{t=2}
       = (1+t, -1+2t, -3+3t)\big|_{t=2}
       = (3, 3, 3)
  </mrow>
  </md>
  and the distance from <m>\vx</m> to <m>P</m> is the distance from
  <m>\vx</m> to <m>\vy</m>, which is

  |\vy-\vx| = 2|\vn| = 2\sqrt{1^2+2^2+3^2} =2\sqrt{14}

  We are again going to find the distance from the point
  <me>
  \vx = (1,-1,-3) \qquad\text{to the plane}\qquad
  P:\ x+2y+3z=18
  </me>
  But this time we will use the following strategy.
  <ul>
  <li> We'll first find any point <m>\vz</m> on <m>P</m> and then
  </li>
  <li> we'll denote by <m>\vy</m> the point on <m>P</m> nearest <m>\vx</m>, and we'll
     denote by <m>\vv</m> the vector from <m>\vx</m> to <m>\vz</m> (see the figure below)
     and then
  </li>
  <li> we'll realize, by looking at the figure, that the vector from <m>\vx</m>
  to <m>\vy</m> is exactly the projection<fn>Now might be a good time to review
  the Definition <xref ref="def_projection"/> of projection.</fn>
   of the vector <m>\vv</m> on <m>\vn</m> so that
  </li>
  <li> the distance from <m>\vx</m> to <m>P</m>, i.e. the length of the vector
  from <m>\vx</m> to <m>\vy</m>, is exactly <m>\left|\text{proj}_\vn\vv \right|</m>.
  </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Now let's find a point on <m>P</m>. The plane <m>P</m> is given by a single equation,
  namely
  <me>
  x+2y+3z=18
  </me>
  in the three unknowns, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>. The easiest way
  to find one solution to this equation is to assign two of the unknowns
  the value zero and then solve for the third unknown. For example, if we
  set <m>x=y=0</m>, then the equation reduces to <m>3z=18</m>. So we may take
  <m>\vz=(0,0,6)</m>.
  </p>

  <p>Then <m>\vv</m>, the vector from <m>\vx=(1,-1,-3)</m> to <m>\vz=(0,0,6)</m> is
  <m>\llt 0-1\,,\,0-(-1)\,,\,6-(-3)  \rgt=\llt -1,1,9\rgt</m> so that,
  by Equation <xref ref="eqn_proj"/>,

  </mrow><mrow>
      &amp;= 2 \llt 1,2,3\rgt

  </md>
  and the distance from <m>\vx</m> to <m>P</m> is

  <mrow>
  \left|{\rm proj}_{\vn}\,\vv\right| = \big|2 \llt 1,2,3\rgt\big|
     =2\sqrt{14}

  </md>
  just as we found in Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-point-plane"/>.
  </p>
</example>


<example xml:id="eg_VPdistance-Planes">
  <p>
  Now we'll increase the degree of difficulty a tiny bit, and compute
  the distance between the planes
  <me>
  P:\ x+2y+2z=1 \qquad\text{and}\qquad
  P':\ 2x+4y+4z=11
  </me>
  By the <q>distance between the planes <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m></q> we mean the shortest
     distance between any pair of points <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> with <m>\vx</m> in <m>P</m>
     and <m>\vx'</m> in <m>P'</m>.
  First observe that the normal vectors

  \vn'=\llt 2,4,4\rgt=2\vn

  to <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m> are parallel to each other. So the planes <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m>
  are parallel to each other. If they had not been parallel, they would have crossed
  and the distance between them would have been zero.
  </p>

  <p>Our strategy for finding the distance will be to

  <li> first find a point <m>\vx</m> on <m>P</m> and then, like we did in Example

  </li>
  <li> start walking away from <m>P</m> in the
  direction of the normal vector <m>\vn</m> and

  <li> keep walking until we hit <m>P'</m>. Call the point on <m>P'</m> that we hit
  <m>\vx'</m>. Then the desired distance is the distance between <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m>.
  From the figure below it does indeed look like distance between <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m>
  is the shortest distance between any pair of points with one point on <m>P</m> and
  one point on <m>P'</m>. Again, this is in fact true, though we won't prove it.

  We can find a point on <m>P</m> just as we did on Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-point-plane-bis"/>. The plane <m>P</m> is given by the single equation

  in the three unknowns, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>. We can find one solution to this

  </p>

  <p>Now imagine that we start walking, and that we start at time <m>t=0</m> at <m>\vx</m>

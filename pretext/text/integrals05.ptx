<title>Triple Integrals</title>

<p>Triple integrals, that is integrals over three dimensional regions,
are just like double integrals, only more so. We decompose the
domain of integration into tiny cubes, for example,
compute the contribution from each cube and then use integrals
to add up all of the different pieces. We'll go through the
details now by means of a number of examples.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_sphere_mass_A">
<statement>
<p>
Find the mass inside the sphere <m>x^2+y^2+z^2=1</m> if the density
is <m>\rho(x,y,z) = |xyz|</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
The absolute values can complicate the computations. We can avoid
those complications by exploiting the fact that,
by symmetry, the total mass of the sphere will be eight times the mass
in the first octant.
We shall cut the first octant part of the sphere into tiny pieces using
Cartesian coordinates. That is, we shall cut it up using planes of
constant <m>z</m>, planes of constant <m>y</m>, and planes of constant <m>x</m>,
which we recall look like

<p>
<ul>
<li><p>
First slice the (the first octant part of the) sphere into horizontal
plates by inserting many planes of
constant <m>z</m>, with the various values of <m>z</m> differing by <m>\dee{z}</m>.
The figure on the left below shows the part of one plate in the first octant
outlined in red. Each plate
<ul>
<li>
has thickness <m>\dee{z}</m>,
</li>
<li>
has <m>z</m> almost constant throughout the plate (it only varies by <m>\dee{z}</m>), and
</li>
<li>
has <m>(x,y)</m> running over <m>x\ge 0</m>, <m>y\ge 0</m>, <m>x^2+y^2\le 1-z^2</m>.
</li>
<li>
The bottom plate starts at <m>z=0</m> and the top plate ends at
<m>z=1</m>. See the figure on the right below.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><p>
Concentrate on any one plate. Subdivide it into long thin <q>square</q> beams
by inserting many planes of constant <m>y</m>, with the various values of <m>y</m> differing by <m>\dee{y}</m>. The figure on the left below shows the part
of one beam in the first octant outlined in blue. Each beam
<ul>
<li>
has cross-sectional area  <m>\dee{y}\,\dee{z}</m>,
</li>
<li>
has <m>z</m>  and <m>y</m> essentially constant throughout the beam, and
</li>
<li>
has <m>x</m> running over <m>0\le x\le \sqrt{1-y^2-z^2}</m>.
</li>
<li> The leftmost beam has, essentially, <m>y=0</m> and the rightmost beam has,
essentially, <m>y=\sqrt{1-z^2}</m>.  See the figure on the right below.

Concentrate on any one beam. Subdivide it into tiny approximate cubes
by inserting many planes of constant <m>x</m>, with the various values of <m>x</m> differing by <m>\dee{x}</m>. The figure on the left below shows the top of one
approximate cube in black. Each cube
<ul>
<li>
has volume <m>\dee{x}\,\dee{y}\,\dee{z}</m>, and
</li>
<li>
has <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> all essentially constant throughout the cube.

<li> The first cube has, essentially, <m>x=0</m> and the last cube has,
essentially, <m>x=\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2}</m>.  See the figure on the right below.

<p>Now we can build up the mass.
<ul>
<li><p>
Concentrate on one approximate cube. Let's say that it contains the point
<m>(x,y,z)</m>.
<ul>
<li>
The cube has volume essentially <m>\dee{V} =  \dee{x}\,\dee{y}\,\dee{z}</m>
and
</li>
<li>
essentially has density <m>\rho(x,y,z) = xyz</m> and so
</li>
<li>
essentially has mass <m>xyz\,\dee{x}\,\dee{y}\,\dee{z}</m>.
</li>
</ul></p>
</li>
<li>
To get the mass of any one beam, say the beam whose <m>y</m> coordinate runs
from <m>y</m> to <m>y+\dee{y}</m>, we just add up the masses of the approximate
cubes in that beam, by integrating <m>x</m> from its smallest value on
the beam, namely <m>0</m>, to its largest value on the beam, namely
<m>\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2}</m>. The mass of the beam is thus

<ul>
<li>
When we are integrating over the innermost integral, with respect to <m>x</m>,
the quantities <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are treated as constants. In particular,
<m>y</m> and <m>z</m> may appear in the limits of integration for the <m>x</m>-integral,
but <m>x</m> may not appear in those limits.
</li>
<li>
When we are integrating over <m>y</m>, we have already integrated out <m>x</m>;
<m>x</m> no longer exists. The quantity <m>z</m> is treated as a constant. In particular,
<m>z</m>, but neither <m>x</m> nor <m>y</m>, may appear in the limits of integration for the <m>y</m>-integral.

Finally, when we are integrating over <m>z</m>, we have already integrated out
<m>x</m> and <m>y</m>; they no longer exist. None of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> or <m>z</m>, may appear in the limits of integration for the <m>z</m>-integral.

<p>
In practice, often the hardest part of dealing with
a triple integral is setting up the limits of integration.
In this example, we'll concentrate on exactly that.
</p>

<p>Let <m>\cV</m> be the solid region in <m>\bbbr^3</m> bounded by the planes
<m>x = 0</m>, <m>y = 0</m>, <m>z=0</m>, <m>y = 4 - x</m>, and the surface <m>z = 4 - x^2</m>. We
are now going to write
<m>\tripInt_\cV f(x, y, z)\ \dee{V}</m> as an iterated integral
(i.e. find the limits of integration) in two different ways.
Here <m>f</m> is just some general, unspecified, function.
</p>

<p>First, we'll figure out what <m>\cV</m> looks like.
The following three figures show
<ul>
<li>
the part of the first octant with <m>y \le 4 - x</m>  (except that
it continues vertically upward)
</li>
<li>
the part of the first octant with <m>z \le 4 - x^2</m> (except that it
continues to the right)
</li>
<li>
the part of the first octant with both <m>y\le 4-x</m> and  <m>z \le 4 - x^2</m>.
That's

\cV=\Set{(x,y,z)}{x\ge 0, y\ge 0,\  z\ge 0,\ x+y\le 4,\ z\le 4-x^2}

<example xml:id="eg_3d_integrals_exchange_of_order">
<p>
As was said in the last example, in practice, often the hardest parts of
dealing with a triple integral concern the limits of integration.
In this example, we'll again concentrate on exactly that. This time, we will consider the integral
<me>
I=\int_0^2\dee{y}\int_0^{2-y}\dee{z}\int_0^{\frac{2-y}{2}}\dee{x}\ f(x,y,z)
</me>
and we will re-express <m>I</m> with the outside integral being over <m>z</m>. We will
figure out the limits of integration for both the order
<m>\int\dee{z}\int\dee{x}\int\dee{y}\ f(x,y,z)</m> and for the order
<m>\int\dee{z}\int\dee{y}\int\dee{x}\ f(x,y,z)</m>.
</p>

<p>Our first task is to get a good idea as to what the domain of integration looks like. We start by reading off of the given integral that
<ul>
<li>
the outside integral says that <m>y</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>2</m>, and
</li>
<li>
the middle integral says that, for each <m>y</m> in that range, <m>z</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>2-y</m> and
</li>
<li>
the inside integral says that, for each <m>(y,z)</m> as above,
<m>x</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>\frac{2-y}{2}</m>.
</li>
</ul>
So the domain of integration is
<me>
V=\Set{(x,y,z)}{ 0\le y\le 2,\
                 0\le z\le 2-y,\
                 0\le x\le \tfrac{2-y}{2}}
\tag{$*$}</me>
We'll sketch <m>V</m> shortly. Because it is generally easier to make 2d sketches than it is to make 3d sketches, we'll first make a 2d sketch of the part of <m>V</m> that lies in the vertical plane <m>y=Y</m>. Here <m>Y</m> is any constant between
<m>0</m> and <m>2</m>. Looking at the definition of <m>V</m>, we see that the point <m>(x,Y,z)</m>
lies in <m>V</m> if and only if
<md>
<mrow>
0\le z\le 2-Y\qquad   0\le x\le \frac{2-Y}{2}
</mrow>
</md>
Here, on the left, is a (2d) sketch of all <m>(x,z)</m>'s that obey those
inequalities, and, on the right, is a (3d) sketch of all <m>(x,Y,z)</m>'s that obey those inequalities.

<sidebyside widths="40% 40%" valign="middle">

</sidebyside>

<p>
So our solid <m>V</m> consists of a bunch of vertical rectangles stacked sideways along the <m>y</m>-axis. The rectangle in the plane <m>y=Y</m> has side lengths
<m>\frac{2-Y}{2}</m> and <m>2-Y</m>. As we move from the plane <m>y=Y=0</m>, i.e. the <m>xz</m>-plane, to the plane <m>y=Y=2</m>, the rectangle decreases in size linearly
from a one by two rectangle, when <m>Y=0</m>, to a zero by zero rectangle,
i.e. a point, when <m>Y=2</m>.
Here is a sketch of <m>V</m> together with a typical <m>y=Y</m> rectangle.

<sidebyside width="50%">

<p>
To re-express the given integral with the outside integral being with respect to <m>z</m>, we have to slice up <m>V</m> into horizontal plates by inserting planes
of constant <m>z</m>. So we have to figure out what the part of <m>V</m> that lies in
the horizontal plane <m>z=Z</m> looks like. From the figure above, we see that, in <m>V</m>, the smallest value of <m>z</m> is <m>0</m> and the biggest value of <m>z</m> is <m>2</m>.
So <m>Z</m> is any constant between <m>0</m> and <m>2</m>. Again looking at the definition of <m>V</m> in <m>(*)</m> above, we see that the point <m>(x,y,Z)</m> lies in <m>V</m> if and only if

y\ge 0\qquad y\le 2\qquad
y\le 2-Z\qquad

2x+y\le 2

Here, on the top, is a (2d) sketch showing the top view of all <m>(x,y)</m>'s
that obey those inequalities, and, on the bottom, is a (3d) sketch of all <m>(x,y,Z)</m>'s that obey those inequalities.

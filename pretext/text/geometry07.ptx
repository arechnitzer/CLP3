  <title>Sketching Surfaces in 3d</title>
<introduction>

<p>In practice students taking multivariable calculus regularly have great
difficulty visualising surfaces in three dimensions, despite the fact
that we all live in three dimensions. We'll now develop some
technique to help us sketch surfaces in three dimensions<fn>Of course you could instead use some fancy graphing software, but part of the point is to
build intuition. Not to mention that you can't use fancy graphing software on
your exam.</fn>.
</p>

<p>We all have a fair
bit of experience drawing curves in two dimensions. Typically the intersection
of a surface (in three dimensions) with a plane is a curve lying in
the (two dimensional) plane. Such an intersection is usually called a cross-section.
In the special case that the plane is one of the coordinate planes, the
intersection is sometimes called a trace. One can often get a pretty good
idea of what a surface looks like by sketching a bunch of cross-sections.
Here are some examples.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_hyperboloid"><title><m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m></title>
<statement>
  <p>
  Sketch the surface that satisfies <m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m>.
  </p>
</statement>
  <solution>
  <p>We'll start by fixing any number <m>z_0</m> and sketching the part of
  the surface that lies in the horizontal plane <m>z=z_0</m>.
</p>
  <sidebyside width="33%">
  <image source="figs/zedzeroPlane"/>
  </sidebyside>
  <p>
  The intersection of our surface with that horizontal plane is a horizontal
  cross-section. Any point <m>(x,y,z)</m> lying on that horizontal cross-section
  satisfies both
  <md>
  <mrow>
  &amp;z=z_0\ \ \text{and}\ \ 4x^2+y^2-z^2=1
  </mrow><mrow>
  \iff
  &amp;z=z_0\ \ \text{and}\ \ 4x^2+y^2=1+z_0^2
  </mrow>
  </md>
  Think of <m>z_0</m> as a constant.
  Then <m>4x^2+y^2=1+z_0^2</m> is a curve in the <m>xy</m>-plane. As <m>1+z_0^2</m> is a constant, the curve is an ellipse. To determine its semi-axes<fn>The
  semi-axes of an ellipse are the line segments from the centre of the ellipse
  to the farthest point on the curve and to the nearest point on the curve.
  For a circle the lengths of both of these line segments are just the  radius.
  </fn>, we observe that
  when <m>y=0</m>, we have <m>x=\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+z_0^2}</m> and when <m>x=0</m>,
  we have <m>y=\pm\sqrt{1+z_0^2}</m>. So the curve is just an ellipse with
  <m>x</m> semi-axis <m>\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+z_0^2}</m> and <m>y</m> semi-axis
  <m>\sqrt{1+z_0^2}</m>. It's easy to sketch.
</p>
  <sidebyside width="55%">
  <image source="figs/ellipse"/>
  </sidebyside>
<p>
  Remember that this ellipse is the part of our surface that lies in the
  plane <m>z=z_0</m>. Imagine that the sketch of the ellipse is on a single
  sheet of paper. Lift the sheet of paper up, move it around so that
  the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes point in the directions of the three dimensional
  <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes and place the sheet of paper into the three
  dimensional sketch at height <m>z_0</m>.
  This gives a single horizontal ellipse in 3d, as in the figure below.
</p>
  <sidebyside width="50%">
  <image source="figs/hyperboloidZX"/>
  </sidebyside>
<p>
  We can build up the full surface by stacking many of these horizontal
  ellipses <mdash/> one for each possible height <m>z_0</m>.
  So we now draw a few of them as in the figure below. To reduce the
  amount of clutter in the sketch, we have only drawn the first octant
  (i.e. the part of three dimensions that has <m>x\ge 0</m>, <m>y\ge 0</m> and <m>z\ge 0</m>).
</p>

  <sidebyside width="45%">
  <image source="figs/hyperboloidZXB"/>
  </sidebyside>

  <p>Here is why it is OK, in this case, to just sketch the first octant.
  Replacing <m>x</m> by <m>-x</m> in the equation <m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m>
  does not change the equation. That means that a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> is on the
  surface if and only if the point <m>(-x,y,z)</m> is on the surface. So the surface
  is invariant under reflection in the <m>yz</m>-plane. Similarly, the equation
  <m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m> does not change when <m>y</m> is replaced by <m>-y</m> or <m>z</m> is
  replaced by <m>-z</m>. Our surface is also invariant reflection in the <m>xz</m>-
  and <m>yz</m>-planes. Once we have the part in the first octant, the remaining
  octants can be gotten simply by reflecting about the coordinate planes.
  </p>

  <p>We can get a more visually meaningful sketch by adding in some vertical
  cross-sections. The <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m> cross-sections (also called traces
  <mdash/> they are the parts of our surface that are in the <m>yz</m>- and <m>xz</m>-planes,
  respectively)
  are
  <me>
  x=0,\ y^2-z^2=1\qquad\text{and}\qquad
  y=0,\ 4x^2-z^2=1
  </me>
  These equations describe hyperbolae<fn>It's not just a figure of speech!</fn>. If you don't remember how to sketch them, don't worry. We'll
  do it now. We'll first sketch them in 2d. Since

  </md>
  the sketches are

     <image source="figs/hyperbolaYa"/>
  </sidebyside>
<p>
  Now we'll incorporate them into the 3d sketch. Once again imagine that each
  is a single sheet of paper. Pick each up and move it into the 3d sketch,
  carefully matching up the axes. The red (blue) parts of the hyperbolas
  above become the red (blue) parts of the 3d sketch below (assuming of course
  that you are looking at this on a colour screen).
  </p>

  <sidebyside width="40%">
  <image source="figs/hyperboloidBa"/>
  </sidebyside>

  <p>
  Now that we have a pretty good idea of what the surface looks like
  we can clean up and simplify the sketch. Here are a couple of
  possibilities.

  Here is a sketch created by graphing software.
  </p>

  <sidebyside  width="66%">
  <image source="figs/hyperboloid1sheet"/>
  </sidebyside>

  <p>
  This type of surface is called a hyperboloid of one sheet.
  </p>

  <p>There are also hyperboloids of two sheets. For example, replacing the <m>+1</m>
  on the right hand side of <m>x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m> gives <m>x^2+y^2-z^2=-1</m>, which is
  a hyperboloid of two sheets. We'll sketch it quickly in the next example.
  </p>
</solution>
</example>

  <example xml:id="eg_hyperboloid_two"><title><m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=-1</m></title>
  <statement>
  <p>
  Sketch the surface that satisfies <m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=-1</m>.
  </p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p> As in the last example, we'll start by fixing any number <m>z_0</m>
  and sketching the part of the surface that lies in the horizontal
  plane <m>z=z_0</m>. The intersection of our surface with that horizontal plane is
  <md>
  <mrow>
  &amp;z=z_0\ \ \text{and}\ \ 4x^2+y^2=z_0^2-1
  </mrow>
  </md>
  Think of <m>z_0</m> as a constant.
  <ul>
  <li>
  If <m>|z_0| \lt 1</m>, then <m>z_0^2-1 \lt 0</m> and there
  are no solutions to <m>x^2+y^2=z_0^2-1</m>.
  </li>
  <li>
  If <m>|z_0|=1</m> there is exactly one solution, namely <m>x=y=0</m>.
  </li>
  <li>
  If <m>|z_0| \gt 1</m> then <m>4x^2+y^2=z_0^2-1</m> is an ellipse with
  <m>x</m> semi-axis <m>\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{z_0^2-1}</m> and <m>y</m> semi-axis
  <m>\sqrt{z_0^2-1}</m>. These semi-axes are small when <m>|z_0|</m> is close to
  <m>1</m> and grow as <m>|z_0|</m> increases.
  </li>
  </ul>
  The first octant parts of a few of these horizontal cross-sections
  are drawn in the figure below.
</p>

  <sidebyside width="45%">
  <image source="figs/hyperboloidZXBB"/>
  </sidebyside>

<p>
  Next we add in the <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m> cross-sections (i.e. the parts of
  our surface that are in the <m>yz</m>- and <m>xz</m>-planes, respectively)
  <me>
  x=0,\ z^2=1+y^2\qquad\text{and}\qquad
  y=0,\ z^2=1+4x^2
  </me>

<p>
  Now that we have a pretty good idea of what the surface looks like
  we clean up and simplify the sketch.

<p>
  This type of surface is called a hyperboloid of two sheets.
  </p>
</solution>
</example>

<example xml:id="eg_hyperbolic_cylinder"><title><m>yz=1</m></title>
<statement>
  <p>
  Sketch the surface <m>yz=1</m>.
  </p>
</statement>

<solution>
  <p>
  This surface has a special property that
  makes it relatively easy to sketch. There are no <m>x</m>'s in the equation
  <m>yz=1</m>. That means that if some <m>y_0</m> and <m>z_0</m> obey <m>y_0z_0=1</m>,
  then the point <m>(x,y_0,z_0)</m> lies on the surface <m>yz=1</m> for all values
  of <m>x</m>. As <m>x</m> runs from <m>-\infty</m> to <m>\infty</m>, the point <m>(x,y_0,z_0)</m>
  sweeps out a straight line parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis. So the surface
  <m>yz=1</m> is a union of lines parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis. It is invariant under
  translations parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis. To sketch <m>yz=1</m>, we just need
  to sketch its intersection with the <m>yz</m>-plane and then translate the
  resulting curve parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis to sweep out the surface.
  </p>

  <p>We'll start with a sketch of the hyperbola <m>yz=1</m> in two dimensions.
</p>
  <sidebyside width="40%">
  <image source="figs/hyperbola3"/>
  </sidebyside>
<p>
  Next we'll move this 2d sketch into the <m>yz</m>-plane, i.e. the plane <m>x=0</m>,
  in 3d, except that we'll only draw in the part in the first octant.
</p>
  <sidebyside width="40%">

  <m>x_0</m>

  and clean up the sketch a bit

  <p>
  Here is a sketch created by graphing software.

</example>

<example xml:id="eg_xyz"><title><m>xyz=4</m></title>
<statement>
  <p>
  Sketch the surface <m>xyz=4</m>.
  </p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
  We'll sketch this surface using much the same procedure as we used
  in Examples <xref ref="eg_hyperboloid"/> and <xref ref="eg_hyperboloid_two"/>.
  We'll only sketch the part of the surface in the first octant. The
  remaining parts (in the octants with <m>x,y \lt 0</m>, <m>z\ge 0</m>, with
  <m>x,z \lt 0</m>, <m>y\ge 0</m> and with <m>y,z \lt 0</m>, <m>x\ge0</m>) are just reflections of
  the first octant part.
  </p>

  <p>As usual, we start by fixing any number <m>z_0</m>
  and sketching the part of the surface that lies in the horizontal
  plane <m>z=z_0</m>. The intersection of our surface with that horizontal plane is
  the hyperbola
  <md>
  <mrow>
  &amp;z=z_0\ \ \text{and}\ \ xy=\frac{1}{z_0}
  </mrow>
  </md>
  Note that <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> as <m>y\rightarrow 0</m> and that
  <m>y\rightarrow\infty</m> as <m>x\rightarrow 0</m>. So the hyperbola
  has both the <m>x</m>-axis and the <m>y</m>-axis as asymptotes, when drawn in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
  The first octant parts of a few of these horizontal cross-sections
  (namely, <m>z_0=4</m>, <m>z_0=2</m> and <m>z_0=\frac{1}{2}</m>)
  are drawn in the figure below.
</p>
  <sidebyside width="45%">
  <image source="figs/seatB"/>
  </sidebyside>
<p>
  Next we add some vertical cross-sections.
  We can't use <m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m> because any point on <m>xyz=1</m>
  must have all of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> nonzero. So we use
  <me>
  x=4,\ yz=1\qquad\text{and}\qquad
  y=4,\ xz=1
  </me>
  instead. They are again hyperbolae.
</p>

  <sidebyside width="45%">

<subsection xml:id="subsec-Level">
  <title>Level Curves and Surfaces</title>

<p>Often the reason you are interested in a surface in 3d is that it is
the graph <m>z=f(x,y)</m> of a function of two variables <m>f(x,y)</m>. Another good
way to visualize the behaviour of a function <m>f(x,y)</m> is to sketch what
are called its level curves. By definition, a level curve of <m>f(x,y)</m>
is a curve whose equation is <m>f(x,y)=C</m>, for some constant <m>C</m>. It is the
set of points in the <m>xy</m>-plane where <m>f</m> takes the value <m>C</m>. Because
it is a curve in 2d, it is usually easier to sketch than the graph of <m>f</m>.
Here are a couple of examples.
</p>

<example><title><m>f(x,y) = x^2+4y^2-2x+2</m></title>
<statement>
  <p>
  Sketch the level curves of <m>f(x,y) = x^2+4y^2-2x+2</m>.
  </p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
  Fix any real number <m>C</m>. Then, for the specified function <m>f</m>,
  the level curve <m>f(x,y)=C</m> is the set of points <m>(x,y)</m> that obey
  <md>
  <mrow>
  x^2+4y^2-2x+2=C
  &amp;\iff x^2-2x+1 + 4y^2 +1 =C
  </mrow><mrow>
  &amp;\iff (x-1)^2 + 4y^2 = C-1
  </mrow>
  </md>
  Now <m>(x-1)^2 + 4y^2</m> is the sum of two squares, and so is always at least zero.
  So if <m>C-1 \lt 0</m>, i.e. if <m>C \lt 1</m>, there is no curve <m>f(x,y)=C</m>. If <m>C-1=0</m>,
  i.e. if <m>C=1</m>, then <m>f(x,y)=C-1=0</m> if and only if both <m>(x-1)^2=0</m> and
  <m>4y^2=0</m> and so the level curve consists of the single point <m>(1,0)</m>.
  If <m>C \gt 1</m>, then <m>f(x,y)=C</m> become <m>(x-1)^2+4y^2=C-1 \gt 0</m> which describes an
  ellipse centred on <m>(1,0)</m>. It intersects the <m>x</m>-axis when <m>y=0</m> and
  <me>
  (x-1)^2 = C-1 \iff x-1=\pm\sqrt{C-1} \iff x=1\pm \sqrt{C-1}
  </me>
  and it intersects the line <m>x=1</m> (i.e. the vertical line through the centre)
  when
  <me>
  4y^2 = C-1 \iff 2y=\pm\sqrt{C-1} \iff y=\pm\tfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{C-1}
  </me>
  So, when <m>C \gt 1</m>, <m>f(x,y)=C</m> is the ellipse centred on <m>(1,0)</m> with
  <m>x</m> semi-axis <m>\sqrt{C-1} </m> and <m>y</m> semi-axis <m>\tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{C-1}</m>.
  Here is a sketch of some representative level curves of
  <m>f(x,y) = x^2+4y^2-2x+2</m>.
</p>
  <sidebyside width="90%">
  <image source="figs/ellipseLevelB"/>
  </sidebyside>
<p>
  It is often easier to develop an understanding of the behaviour of a function
  <m>f(x,y)</m> by looking at a sketch of its level curves, than it is by looking
  at a sketch of its graph. On the other hand, you can also
  use a sketch of the level curves of <m>f(x,y)</m> as the first step in building
  a sketch of the graph <m>z=f(x,y)</m>. The next step would be to redraw,
  for each <m>C</m>, the level curve <m>f(x,y)=C</m>, in the plane <m>z=C</m>, as we did in
  Example <xref ref="eg_hyperboloid"/>.
  </p>
</solution>
</example>


<example><title><m>e^{x+y+z}=1</m></title>
<statement>
  <p>
  The function <m>f(x,y)</m> is given implicitly by the equation <m>e^{x+y+z}=1</m>.
  Sketch the level curves of <m>f</m>.
  </p>
</statement>

<solution>
  <p>
  This one is not as nasty as it appears.
  That <q><m>f(x,y)</m> is given implicitly by the equation <m>e^{x+y+z}=1</m></q>
  means that, for each <m>x,y</m>,  the solution <m>z</m> of <m>e^{x+y+z}=1</m> is
  <m>f(x,y)</m>. So, for the specified function <m>f</m> and any fixed real number <m>C</m>,
  the level curve <m>f(x,y)=C</m> is the set of points <m>(x,y)</m> that obey
  <md>
  <mrow>
  e^{x+y+C}=1
  &amp;\iff x+y+C = 0\qquad\text{(by taking the logarithm of both sides)}
  </mrow><mrow>
  &amp;\iff x+y = -C
  </mrow>
  </md>
  This is of course a straight line. It intersects the <m>x</m>-axis when <m>y=0</m>
  and <m>x=-C</m> and it intersects the <m>y</m>-axis when <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=-C</m>.
  Here is a sketch of some level curves.
  </p>

  <sidebyside width="60%">
  <image source="figs/planeLevel"/>
  </sidebyside>

</solution>
</example>

<p>We have just seen that sketching the level curves of a function <m>f(x,y)</m>
can help us understand the behaviour of <m>f</m>. We can generalise this
to functions <m>F(x,y,z)</m> of three variables. A level surface of <m>F(x,y,z)</m>
is a surface whose equation is of the form <m>F(x,y,z)=C</m> for some
constant <m>C</m>. It is the set of points <m>(x,y,z)</m> at which <m>F</m> takes
the value <m>C</m>.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_level_surface_sphere"><title><m>F(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2</m></title>
  <p>
  Let <m>F(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2</m>. If <m>C \gt 0</m>, then the level surface
  <m>F(x,y,z)=C</m> is the sphere of radius <m>\sqrt{C}</m> centred on the origin.
  Here is a sketch of the parts of the level surfaces
             <m>F=1</m> (radius <m>1</m>),
             <m>F=4</m> (radius <m>2</m>) and
             <m>F=9</m> (radius <m>3</m>)
  that are in the first octant.

<p>
  Let <m>F(x,y,z)=x^2+z^2</m> and <m>C \gt 0</m>. Consider the level surface
  <m>x^2+z^2=C</m>.  The variable <m>y</m> does not appear in this equation.
  So for any fixed <m>y_0</m>, the intersection of the our surface
  <m>x^2+z^2=C</m> with the plane <m>y=y_0</m> is the circle of radius <m>\sqrt{C}</m>

  one such circle.

  <m>e^{x+y+z}=C</m>, or equivalently, <m>x+y+z=\ln C</m>. It is the plane
  that contains the intercepts <m>(\ln C,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,\ln C,0)</m> and
  <m>(0,0,\ln C)</m>.
  Here is a sketch of the parts of the level surfaces
  <ul>
  <li>       <m>F=e</m> (intercepts <m>(1,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,1,0)</m>, <m>(0,0,1)</m>),
  </li>
  <li>       <m>F=e^2</m> (intercepts <m>(2,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,2,0)</m>, <m>(0,0,2)</m>) and
  </li>
  <li>       <m>F=e^3</m> (intercepts <m>(3,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,3,0)</m>, <m>(0,0,3)</m>)
  </li>
  </ul>
  that are in the first octant.

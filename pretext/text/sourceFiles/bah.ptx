\chaptermark{Vectors and Geometry}
</p>

<p>Before we get started doing calculus in two and three dimensions 
we need to brush up on some basic geometry, that we will use a lot. 
We are already familiar with the Cartesian plane
<fn>Ren\'e Descartes
(1596--1650) was a French scientist and philosopher, who lived in the Dutch Republic for roughly twenty years after serving in the (mercenary) Dutch States Army.
He is viewed as the father of analytic geometry, which uses numbers
to study geometry.</fn>
,  but we'll start from the beginning.
</p>

<p>\section{Points}xml:id="sec_points"
</p>

<p>Each point in two dimensions may be labeled by two coordinates
<fn>This is why the <m>xy</m>-plane is called <q>two dimensional</q> <mdash/> the name of each point consists of two real numbers.</fn>
</p>

<p><m>(x,y)</m> which specify the position of the point in some units with respect
to some axes as in the figure below. 
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/point2d.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
The set of all points in two dimensions is denoted
<fn>Not surprisingly,
the <m>2</m> in <m>\bbbr^2</m> signifies that each point is labelled by two numbers
and the <m>\bbbr</m> in <m>\bbbr^2</m> signifies that the numbers in question are
real numbers. There are more advanced applications (for example in
signal analysis and in quantum mechanics) where complex numbers are used.
The space of all pairs <m>(z_1,z_2)</m>, with <m>z_1</m> and <m>z_2</m> complex numbers 
is denoted  <m>\bbbc^2</m>.</fn>
 <m>\bbbr^2</m>.
Observe that 
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y)</m> to the <m>x</m>-axis is <m>|y|</m>
</li>
<li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y)</m> to the <m>y</m>-axis is <m>|x|</m>
</li>
<li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y)</m> to the origin <m>(0,0)</m> is 
     <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Similarly, each point in three dimensions may be labeled by 
three coordinates <m>(x,y,z)</m>, as in the two figures below.

The set of all points in three dimensions is denoted <m>\bbbr^3</m>.
The plane that contains, for example, the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes
is called the <m>xy</m>-plane.
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li> The <m>xy</m>-plane is the set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that
satisfy <m>z=0</m>.
</li>
<li> The <m>xz</m>-plane is the set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that
satisfy <m>y=0</m>.
</li>
<li> The <m>yz</m>-plane is the set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that
satisfy <m>x=0</m>.
</li>
</ul>
More generally,
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li> The set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that obey <m>z=c</m> is a plane
that is parallel to the <m>xy</m>-plane and is a distance <m>|c|</m> from it. 
If <m>c \gt 0</m>, the plane <m>z=c</m> is above the <m>xy</m>-plane.
If <m>c \lt 0</m>, the plane <m>z=c</m> is below the <m>xy</m>-plane.
We say that the plane <m>z=c</m> is a signed distance <m>c</m> from the
<m>xy</m>-plane.
</li>
<li> The set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that obey <m>y=b</m> is a plane
that is parallel to the <m>xz</m>-plane and is a signed distance <m>b</m> from it.
</li>
<li> The set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that obey <m>x=a</m> is a plane
that is parallel to the <m>yz</m>-plane and is a signed distance <m>a</m> from it.

</ul>

Observe that our 2d distances extend quite easily to 3d.
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the <m>xy</m>-plane is <m>|z|</m>
</li>
<li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the <m>xz</m>-plane is <m>|y|</m>
</li>
<li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the <m>yz</m>-plane is <m>|x|</m>

<li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the origin <m>(0,0,0)</m> is 
     <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}</m>
</li>
</ul>
To see that the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the origin <m>(0,0,0)</m> 
is indeed  <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}</m>,
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li> 
apply Pythagoras to the right-angled triangle with vertices <m>(0,0,0)</m>,
<m>(x,0,0)</m> and <m>(x,y,0)</m> to see that the distance from <m>(0,0,0)</m>
to <m>(x,y,0)</m> is <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m> and then
</li>
<li> 
apply Pythagoras to the right-angled triangle with vertices <m>(0,0,0)</m>,
<m>(x,y,0)</m> and <m>(x,y,z)</m> to see that the distance from <m>(0,0,0)</m>
to <m>(x,y,z)</m> is <m>\sqrt{{\big(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\big)}^2+z^2}
=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<sidebyside>

</sidebyside>
<p>
More generally, the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the point 
<m>(x',y',z')</m> is
<me>
\sqrt{(x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+(z-z')^2}
</me>
Notice that this gives us the equation for a sphere quite directly. 
All the points on a sphere are equidistant from the centre of the sphere.
So, for example, the equation of the sphere centered on <m>(1,2,3)</m> with 
radius <m>4</m>, that is, the set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> whose distance 
from <m>(1,2,3)</m> is <m>4</m>, is 
<me>
(x-1)^2+(y-2)^2+(z-3)^2=16
</me>

<p>\section{Vectors}xml:id="sec_vectors"
</p>

<p>In many of our applications in 2d and 3d, we will encounter quantities
that have both a magnitude (like a distance) and also a 
direction. Such quantities are called vectors. That is,
a <em>vector</em> is a quantity which has both a direction and a magnitude,
like a velocity. If you are moving, the magnitude (length) of your 
velocity vector is your speed (distance travelled per unit time)  and the
direction of your velocity vector is your direction of motion. To specify 
a vector in three dimensions you have to give three components, just as for 
a point. To draw the vector with components <m>\ a,\ b,\ c\ </m> you can draw 
an arrow from the point <m>(0,0,0)</m> to the point <m>(a,b,c)</m>. 
\vadjust{

      <image source="problems/figs/vector3d.pdf"/>
      </sidebyside>
<p>
        }
Similarly, to specify a vector in two dimensions
you have to give two components and to draw the vector
with components <m>\ a,\ b\ </m> you can draw an arrow from the point <m>(0,0)</m>
to the point <m>(a,b)</m>.
</p>

<p>There are many situations in which it is preferable to draw a vector 
with its tail at some point other than the origin. For example, it is 
natural to draw the velocity vector of a moving particle with the tail
of the velocity vector at the position of the particle, whether or not
the particle is at the origin. The sketch below shows a moving particle
and its velocity vector at two different times.

As a second example, suppose that you are analyzing the motion of a pendulum.
There are three forces acting on the pendulum bob: gravity <m>\vg</m>, which
is pulling the bob straight down, tension <m>\vt</m> in the rod, which is
pulling the bob in the direction of the rod, and air resistance <m>\vr</m>, 
which is pulling the bob in a direction opposite to its direction of motion.
All three forces are acting on the bob. So it is natural to draw all three
arrows representing the forces with their tails at the ball.

<p>In this text, we will used bold faced letters, like <m>\vv</m>, <m>\vt</m>, <m>\vg</m>,
to designate vectors. In handwriting, it is clearer to use a small 
overhead arrow
<fn>Some people use an underline, as in <m>\underline{v</fn>
</m>,
rather than an arrow.}, as in <m>\vec{v}</m>, <m>\vec{t}</m>, <m>\vec{g}</m>, instead. 
Also, when we want to emphasise that some quantity is a number,
rather than a vector, we will call the number a <em>scalar</em>. 
</p>

<p>Both points and vectors in 2d are specified by two numbers. Until 
you get used to this, it might confuse you sometimes <mdash/> does a given pair of 
numbers represent a point or a vector?
To distinguish
<fn>Or, in the Wikipedia jargon, disambiguate.</fn>
</p>

<p>between the components of a vector and the coordinates 
of the point at its head, when its tail is at some point other than 
the origin, we shall use angle brackets rather than round brackets 
around the components of a vector. For example, the figure below shows 
the two-dimensional vector <m>\llt 2,1\rgt</m> drawn in three different positions.
In each case, when the tail is at the point <m>(u,v)</m> the head is at 
<m>(2+u,1+v)</m>. We warn you that, out in the  real world
<fn>OK. OK. Out in 
that (admittedly very small) part of the real world that actually knows 
what a vector is.</fn>
, no one uses notation
that distinguishes between components of a vector and the coordinates of its 
head <mdash/> usually round brackets are used for both. It is up to you to 
keep straight which is being referred to.

<p>\subsection{Addition of Vectors and Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar}
</p>

<p>Just as we have done many times in the CLP texts, when we define a new 
type of object, we want to understand how it interacts with the basic 
operations of addition and multiplication. Vectors are no different, and 
the following is a natural way to define addition of vectors.
Multiplication will be more subtle, and we start with multiplication of a vector by a number (rather than with multiplication of a vector by 
another vector).
</p>

<p><definition><title>Adding Vectors and Multiplying a Vector by a Number</title>
<statement><p>
             xml:id="def_addScalMult"
These two operations have the obvious definitions
<md alignment="alignat">

&amp;\va=\llt a_1,a_2\rgt,\ \vb =\llt b_1,b_2\rgt
             \qquad&amp;&amp;\implies\qquad\va+\vb=\llt a_1+b_1,a_2+b_2\rgt
</mrow><mrow>

and similarly in three dimensions.
</p></statement>
</definition> 
Pictorially, you add the vector <m>\vb</m> to the vector <m>\va</m> 
by drawing <m>\vb</m> with its tail at the head of <m>\va</m> and then drawing
a vector from the tail of <m>\va</m> to the head of <m>\vb</m>, as in the figure
on the left below. For a number <m>s</m>, we can draw the vector <m>s\va</m>, by 
just 
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li>
changing the vector <m>\va</m>'s length by the factor <m>|s|</m>, and,
</li>
<li>
if <m>s \lt 0</m>, reversing the arrow's direction,
</li>
</ul>
as in the other two figures below.

  </sidebyside>
<p>
The special case of multiplication by <m>s=-1</m> appears so frequently that
<m>(-1)\va</m> is given the shorter notation <m>-\va</m>. That is, 
<me>
-\llt a_1,a_2\rgt=\llt -a_1,-a_2\rgt
</me>
Of course <m>\va+(-\va)</m> is <m>\vZero</m>, the vector all of whose components
are zero. 
</p>

<p>To subtract <m>\vb</m> from <m>\va</m> pictorially, 
you may add <m>-\vb</m> (which is drawn by reversing the direction of <m>\vb</m>)
 to <m>\va</m>. Alternatively,
if you draw <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m> with their tails at a common point,
then <m>\va-\vb</m> is the vector from the head of <m>\vb</m> to
the head of <m>\va</m>. That is, <m>\va-\vb</m> is the vector you
must add to <m>\vb</m> in order to get <m>\va</m>.

<p>The operations of addition and multiplication by a scalar that we have just
defined are quite natural and rarely cause any problems, because 
they inherit from the real numbers the properties of  addition and

We'll explain the little hats in the notation <m>\hi</m>, <m>\hj</m>, <m>\hk</m> shortly.
Some people rename <m>\hi</m>, <m>\hj</m> and <m>\hk</m> to <m>\he_1</m>, <m>\he_2</m> and 
<m>\he_3</m> respectively.
Using the above properties we have, for all vectors,
<me>
\llt a_1,a_2\rgt =a_1\,\hi+a_2\,\hj\qquad\qquad
\llt a_1,a_2,a_3\rgt =a_1\,\hi+a_2\,\hj+a_3\,\hk
</me>
A sum of numbers times vectors, like <m>a_1\hi+a_2\hj</m> is called
a linear combination of the vectors.
Thus all vectors can be expressed as linear combinations of the standard
basis vectors. This makes basis vectors very helpful in computations.
The  standard basis vectors are unit vectors, meaning that they are of 
length one, where the length of a vector <m>\va</m> is denoted
<fn>The notation <m>\|\va\|</m> is also used for the length of <m>\va</m>.</fn>
 <m>|\va|</m>

A unit vector is a vector of length one. We'll sometimes use the accent

<m>\frac{\va}{|\va|}</m> is a unit vector that has the same direction as

We will now use vectors to figure out our final location.
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li>
On the first leg of our walk, we go 4 units in the positive <m>x</m>-direction.
So our displacement vector <mdash/> the vector whose tail is at our starting point and whose head is at the end point of the first leg <mdash/> is <m>\llt 4,0\rgt</m>. 
As we started at <m>(0,0)</m> we finish the first leg of the walk at <m>(4,0)</m>.
</li>
<li>
On the second leg of our walk, our direction of motion is northeast. i.e. is
<m>45^\circ</m> above the direction of the positive <m>x</m>-axis. Looking at the figure 
on the right above, we see that our displacement vector, for the second leg of the walk, has to be in the same direction as the vector <m>\llt 1,1\rgt</m>.
So our displacement vector is the vector of length <m>5\sqrt{2}</m> with the same direction as <m>\llt 1,1\rgt</m>. The vector <m>\llt 1,1\rgt</m> has length
<m>\sqrt{1^2+1^2}=\sqrt{2}</m> and so <m>\frac{\llt 1,1\rgt}{\sqrt{2}}</m> has length one
and our displacement vector is
<me>
5\sqrt{2}\ \frac{\llt 1,1\rgt}{\sqrt{2}}
=5 \llt 1,1\rgt 
=\llt 5,5\rgt
</me>
If we draw this displacement vector, <m>\llt 5,5\rgt</m> with its tail at 
<m>(4,0)</m>, the starting point of the second leg of the walk, then its head 
will be at <m>(4+5, 0+5)=(9,5)</m> and that is the end point of the second 
leg of the walk.
</li>
<li>
On the final leg of our walk, we start at <m>(9,5)</m> and walk towards <m>(0,11)</m>.
The vector from <m>(9,5)</m> to <m>(0,11)</m> is <m>\llt 0-9\,,\,11-5\rgt =\llt -9,6\rgt</m>.
As we go only one third of the way, our final displacement vector is
<me>
\frac{1}{3}\llt -9,6\rgt
=\llt -3,2\rgt
</me>
If we draw this displacement vector with its tail at

<p>\subsection{The Dot Product}
</p>

<p>Let's get back to the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication.
We will be using both scalars and vectors. So, for each operation there are 
three possibilities that we need to explore: 
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li> <q>scalar plus scalar</q>, <q>scalar plus vector</q> and <q>vector plus vector</q>
</li>
<li><q>scalar times scalar</q>, <q>scalar times vector</q> and 
         <q>vector times vector</q>
</li>
</ul>
We have been using <q>scalar plus scalar</q> and <q>scalar times scalar</q>
since childhood. <q>vector plus vector</q> and <q>scalar times vector</q>
were just defined above. There is no sensible way to define <q>scalar plus vector</q>, so we won't. This leaves <q>vector times vector</q>. 
There are actually two widely used such products.
The first is the <em>dot product</em>, which is the topic of this section,
and which is used to easily determine the angle <m>\theta</m> (or more precisely,
<m>\cos\theta</m>) between two vectors.
We'll get to the second, the cross product, later. 
<definition><title>Dot Product</title>
<statement><p>xml:id="def_dotProd"
The dot product of the vectors <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m> is denoted <m>\va\cdot\vb</m>

The properties of the dot

</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_1c_1+a_2c_2
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>Property 6 is sufficiently important that it is often used as the 
definition of dot product. It is not at all an obvious consequence of the definition.
To verify it, we just write <m>|\va-\vb|^2</m> in two different ways. 
The first expresses <m>|\va-\vb|^2</m> in terms of <m>\va\cdot\vb</m>. 
It is
<md>
<mrow>
|\va-\vb|^2\ &amp;{\buildrel 1 \over =}\ (\va-\vb\,)\cdot(\va-\vb\,)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;{\buildrel 3 \over =}\ \va\cdot\va-\va\cdot\vb-\vb\cdot\va
+\vb\cdot\vb
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;{\buildrel 1,2 \over =}\ |\va|^2+|\vb|^2-2\va\cdot\vb
</mrow>
</md>
Here, <m>{\buildrel 1 \over =}</m>, for
example, means that the equality is  a consequence of property 1.
The second way we write <m>|\va-\vb|^2</m> involves <m>\cos\theta</m> and follows from
the cosine law for triangles. Just in case you don't remember the 
cosine law, we'll derive it right now! Start by applying Pythagoras to the 
shaded triangle in the right hand figure of
</p>


<sidebyside> 
      <image source="problems/figs/cosineB.pdf"/>
      </sidebyside>
<p>
That triangle is a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length <m>|\va-\vb|</m> 
and  whose other two sides have lengths <m>\big(|\vb|-|\va|\cos\theta\big)</m> 
and <m>|\va|\sin\theta</m>. So Pythagoras gives
<md>
<mrow>
|\va-\vb|^2&amp;=\big(|\vb|-|\va|\cos\theta\big)^2+
\big(|\va|\sin\theta\big)^2
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=|\vb|^2-2|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta+|\va|^2\cos^2\theta
+|\va|^2\sin^2\theta
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=|\vb|^2-2|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta+|\va|^2
</mrow>
</md>
This is precisely the cosine law
<fn>You may be used to seeing it written as <m>c^2=a^2+b^2-2 a b \cos C</m>, where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are the lengths of the 
three sides of the triangle and <m>C</m> is the angle opposite the side of length <m>c</m></fn>
. 
Observe that, when <m>\theta=\tfrac{\pi}{2}</m>, 
this reduces to, (surprise!) Pythagoras' theorem.
</p>

<p>Setting our two expressions for <m>|\va-\vb|^2</m> equal to each other,
<md>
<mrow>
|\va-\vb|^2=|\va|^2+|\vb|^2-2\va\cdot\vb
=|\vb|^2-2|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta+|\va|^2
</mrow>
</md>
cancelling the <m>|\va|^2</m> and <m>|\vb|^2</m> common to both sides
<md>
<mrow>
-2\va\cdot\vb
=-2|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta
</mrow>
</md>
and dividing by <m>-2</m> gives 
<md>
<mrow>
\va\cdot\vb=|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta
</mrow>
</md>
which is exactly property 6. 
</p>

<p>Property 7 follows directly from property 6. First note that the dot product <m>\va\cdot\vb=|\va|\,|\vb|\,\cos\theta</m>
is zero if and only if at least one of the three factors 
<m>|\va|,\ |\vb|,\ \cos\theta</m> is zero. The first factor is zero if
and only if <m>\va=\vZero </m>. The second factor is zero if and only if 
<m>\vb=\vZero </m>.
The third factor is zero if and only if <m>\theta=\pm\tfrac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi</m>,
for some integer <m>k</m>, which in turn is true if and only if <m>\va</m> and 
<m>\vb</m> are mutually perpendicular.
</p></proof>
Because of Property 7 of Theorem <xref ref="thm_dotPppties"/>, the dot product 
can be used to test whether or not two vectors are perpendicular to 
each other. That is, whether or not the angle between the two vectors 
is <m>90^\circ</m>. Another name
<fn>The concepts of the dot product
and perpendicularity have been generalized a lot in mathematics (for example,
from 2d and 3d vectors to functions). The generalization of the dot 
product is called the <q>inner product</q> and the generalization 
of perpendicularity is called <q>orthogonality</q>.</fn>
 for <q>perpendicular</q> 
is <q>orthogonal</q>. Testing for orthogonality is one of the main uses of the
dot product.

Consider the three vectors

Since both <m>|\va|=|\vb|=\sqrt{1^2+1^2+0^2}=\sqrt{2}</m> the first dot product
tells us that the angle, <m>\theta</m>, between <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m> obeys

<p>Dot products are also used to compute projections.  First, here's
the definition.
</p>

<p><definition><title>Projection</title>
<statement><p>xml:id="def_projection"
Draw two vectors, <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m>,
with their tails at a common point and drop a perpendicular from the head of
<m>\va</m> to the line that passes through both the head and tail of <m>\vb</m>. 
By definition, the projection of the vector <m>\va</m>
on the vector <m>\vb</m> is the vector from the tail of <m>\vb</m> to the point
on the line where the perpendicular hits.
      </p>
<sidebyside> 
      <image source="problems/figs/projA.pdf"/>\qquad\qquad
      <image source="problems/figs/projB.pdf"/>
      </sidebyside>
</statement>
</definition>\noindent
Think of the projection of <m>\va</m> on <m>\vb</m> as the part of <m>\va</m> that is in the 
direction of <m>\vb</m>.
</p>

<p>Now let's develop a formula for the projection of <m>\va</m> on <m>\vb</m>.
Denote by <m>\theta</m> the angle between <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m>. If <m>|\theta|</m> is no
more than <m>90^\circ</m>, as in the figure on the left above, 
the length of the projection of <m>\va</m> on <m>\vb</m> is 
<m>|\va|\cos\theta</m>.
By Property 6 of Theorem <xref ref="thm_dotPppties"/>,  
<m>|\va|\cos\theta=\va\cdot\vb/|\vb|</m>, so the
projection is a vector whose length is <m>\va\cdot\vb/|\vb|</m> and
whose direction is given by the unit vector <m>\vb/|\vb|</m>. Hence
<md>
<mrow>
\text{projection of <m>\va</m> on <m>\vb</m>}={\rm proj}_{\vb}\,\va
=\frac{\va\cdot\vb}{|\vb|}\frac{\vb}{|\vb|}
=\frac{\va\cdot\vb}{|\vb|^2}\,\vb
</mrow>
</md>
If <m>|\theta|</m> is larger than <m>90^\circ</m>, as in the figure on the right above, the projection has length 
<m>|\va|\,\cos(\pi-\theta)=-|\va|\cos\theta=-\va\cdot\vb/|\vb|</m>
 and direction <m>-\vb/|\vb|</m>. In this case
<md>
<mrow>
{\rm proj}_{\vb}\,\va
=-\frac{\va\cdot\vb}{|\vb|}\frac{-\vb}{|\vb|}
=\frac{\va\cdot\vb}{|\vb|^2}\ \vb
</mrow>
</md>
So the formula 
\begin{impeqn}xml:id="eqn_proj"
<me>
{\rm proj}_{\vb}\,\va=\frac{\va\cdot\vb}{|\vb|^2}\,\vb
</me> 
\end{impeqn}\noindent
is applicable whenever <m>\vb\ne\vZero </m>. As a special case, if <m>\vb</m> happens 
to be a unit vector, which, for emphasis, we'll now write has <m>\hat\vb</m>, 
the projection formula simplifies to
\begin{impeqn}xml:id="eqn_unit_proj"
<md>
<mrow>
{\rm proj}_{\hat\vb}\,\va
=  (\va\cdot\hat\vb)\,\hat\vb
</mrow>
</md>
\end{impeqn}
</p>

<p><example>
<p>xml:id="eg_proj"
In this example, we will find the projection of the vector <m>\llt 0,3\rgt</m>
on the vector <m>\llt 1,1\rgt</m>, as in the figure
      </p>
<sidebyside> 
      <image source="problems/figs/projEg.pdf"/>
      </sidebyside>
<p>
By Equation <xref ref="eqn_proj"/> with <m>\va=\llt 0,3\rgt</m> and <m>\vb=\llt 1,1\rgt</m>, 
that projection is
<md>
<mrow>
{\rm proj}_{\llt 1,1\rgt}\,\llt 0,3\rgt
  &amp;=\frac{\llt 0,3\rgt\cdot\llt 1,1\rgt}{|\llt 1,1\rgt|^2}\,\llt 1,1\rgt 
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;=\frac{0\times1+3\times 1}{1^2+1^2}\,\llt 1,1\rgt
  =\llt \frac{3}{2},\frac{3}{2}\rgt
</mrow>
</md>

<p>One use of projections is to <q>resolve forces</q>. There is an example in
the next (optional) section.
</p>

<p>\subsection{(Optional) Using Dot Products to Resolve Forces
<mdash/> The Pendulum}
</p>

<p>Model a pendulum by a mass <m>m</m> that is connected to a hinge by an idealized
rod that is massless and of fixed length <m>\ell</m>. Denote by <m>\theta</m> the angle
between the rod and vertical. The forces acting on the mass are
<ul>
<li> gravity, which has magnitude <m>mg</m> and direction <m>\llt 0,-1\rgt</m>,
</li>
<li> tension in the rod, whose magnitude <m>\tau(t)</m> automatically 
adjusts itself so that the distance between the mass and the hinge is fixed 
at <m>\ell</m> (so that the rod does not stretch or contract) and whose 
direction is always parallel to the rod,
</li>
<li> and possibly some frictional
forces, like friction in the hinge and air resistance. Assume
that the total frictional force has magnitude proportional
<fn>The
behaviour of air resistance (sometimes called drag) is pretty complicated. 
We're using a reasonable low speed approximation. At high speeds drag is typically proportional to the square of the speed.</fn>
 to the speed of the 
mass and has direction opposite to the direction of motion of the mass.
We'll call the constant of proportionality <m>\beta</m>.
</li>
</ul>
      </p>
<sidebyside> 
      <image source="problems/figs/pendulum3.pdf"/>
      </sidebyside>
<p>
If we use a coordinate system centered on the hinge, the <m>(x,y)</m> coordinates

<mrow>
x(t)&amp;=\ell\sin\theta(t)

y(t)&amp;=-\ell\cos\theta(t)

to determine now <m>\theta</m> evolves in time. By definition, the

<p>The negative of the velocity vector is

<me>
-\beta\ell\, \diff{\theta}{t}\llt \cos\theta,\sin\theta\rgt

with <m>\beta</m> our constant of proportionality. 
</p>

<p>The vector 
<me>
\tau(t) \llt -\sin\theta(t),\cos\theta(t)\rgt 
</me>
has magnitude <m>\tau(t)</m> and direction parallel to the rod pointing 
from the mass towards the hinge and so is the force due to tension 
in the rod. 
</p>

<p>Hence, for this physical system, Newton's law of motion is 
\begin{align}
&amp;\overbrace{m\ell\,\ddiff{2}{\theta}{t}\llt \cos\theta,\sin\theta\rgt

\tag{<m>*</m>}
\end{align}
This is a rather complicated looking equation. Writing out its <m>x</m>- and
<m>y</m>-components doesn't help. They also look complicated.
Instead, the equation can be considerably simplified (and 
consequently better understood) by <q>taking its components parallel to
and perpendicular to the direction of motion</q>. From the velocity vector
<m>\vv(t)</m>, we see that <m>\llt \cos\theta(t),\sin\theta(t)\rgt </m> is a unit 
vector parallel to the direction of motion at time <m>t</m>.
Recall, from <xref ref="eqn_unit_proj"/>, that the projection of any vector 
<m>\vb</m> on any unit vector <m>\hat\vd</m> 
(with the <q>hat</q> on <m>\hat\vd</m> reminding ourselves that the vector is a unit
vector) is
<md>
<mrow>
</p>

<p>\big(\vb\cdot \hat\vd\big)\,\hat\vd
</mrow>
</md>
The coefficient <m>\vb\cdot \hat\vd</m> is, by definition, the
component of <m>\vb</m> in the direction <m>\hat\vd</m>.
So, by dotting both sides of the equation of motion <m>(*)</m> with
<m>\hat\vd=\llt \cos\theta(t),\sin\theta(t)\rgt </m>, we extract the component 
parallel to the direction of motion. Since

</mrow><mrow>
\llt \cos\theta,\sin\theta\rgt \cdot\llt 0,-1\rgt &amp;=-\sin\theta

</md>
this gives
<md>
<mrow> 
m\ell\ddiff{2}{\theta}{t}=-mg\sin\theta-\beta\ell\diff{\theta}{t}
</mrow>
</md>
which is <em>much</em> cleaner than <m>(*)</m>!
When <m>\theta</m> is small, we can approximate <m>\sin\theta\approx\theta</m> 
and get the equation
<md>
<mrow>
\ddiff{2}{\theta}{t}+\frac{\beta}{m}\diff{\theta}{t}+\frac{g}{\ell}\theta=0
</mrow>
</md>
which is easily solved. There are systematic procedures for finding 
the solution, but we'll just guess. 
</p>

<p>When there is no friction (so that <m>\beta=0</m>),
we would expect the pendulum to just oscillate. So it is natural to guess
<me>
\theta(t)=A\sin(\omega t-\delta)
</me>
which is an oscillation with (unknown) amplitude <m>A</m>, 
frequency <m>\omega</m> (radians per unit time) and 
phase <m>\delta</m>. Substituting this guess into the left hand side, 
<m>\theta</q>+\tfrac{g}{\ell}\theta</m>,  yields 
<me>
-A\omega^2\sin(\omega t-\delta)+A\tfrac{g}{\ell}\sin(\omega t-\delta)
</me> 
which is zero if <m>\omega=\sqrt{g/\ell}</m>. So
<m>\ \theta(t)=A\sin(\omega t-\delta)\ </m> is a solution for any amplitude 
<m>A</m> and phase <m>\delta</m>, provided the frequency <m>\omega=\sqrt{g/\ell}</m>. 
</p>

<p>When there is some, but not too much, friction, so that <m>\beta \gt 0</m> is 
relatively small, we would expect <q>oscillation with decaying amplitude</q>. 
So we  guess 
<me>
\theta(t)=Ae^{-\gamma t}\sin(\omega t-\delta)
</me>
for some constant decay rate <m>\gamma</m>, to be determined.
With this guess,

<p>\subsection{(Optional) Areas of Parallelograms}xml:id="sec_GEOparallelogram"
</p>

<p>A parallelogram is naturally determined by the two vectors that 
define its sides. We'll now develop a formula for the area of a
parallelogram in terms of these two vectors. 
</p>

<p>Construct a parallelogram as follows. Pick two vectors <m>\llt a,b\rgt </m> 
and <m>\llt c,d\rgt </m>. Draw them with their tails at a common point. Then 
draw <m>\llt a,b\rgt </m> a second time with its tail at the head of 
<m>\llt c,d\rgt </m> and draw  <m>\llt c,d\rgt </m> a second time with its tail 
at the head of <m>\llt a,b\rgt </m>. If the common point is the
origin, you get a picture like the figure below.
\vadjust{
      </p>
<sidebyside> 
      <image source="problems/figs/area3"/>
      </sidebyside>
<p>
        }
Any parallelogram can be constructed like this if you pick the common point
and two vectors appropriately. Let's compute the area of the parallelogram.
The area of the large rectangle with vertices <m>(0,0),\ (0, b+d),\ (a+c,0)</m>
and <m>(a+c,b+d)</m> is <m>(a+c)(b+d)</m>. The parallelogram we want can be extracted
from the large rectangle by deleting the two small rectangles (each of
area <m>bc</m>), and the two lightly shaded triangles (each of area <m>\half cd</m>),
and the two darkly shaded triangles (each of area <m>\half ab</m>). So the desired
<md>
<mrow>
{\rm area} = (a+c)(b+d) - (2\times bc) -\big(2\times \half cd\big)
 -\big(2\times\half ab\big)
=ad-bc
</mrow>
</md>
In the above figure, we have implicitly assumed that <m>a,\ b,\ c,\ d\ge 0</m>
and <m>d/c\ge b/a</m>. In words, we have assumed that both vectors 
<m>\llt a,b\rgt ,\ \llt c,d\rgt </m> lie in the first quadrant and that 
<m>\llt c,d\rgt </m> lies above <m>\llt a,b\rgt </m>.
By simply interchanging <m>a\leftrightarrow c</m> and <m>b\leftrightarrow d</m>
in the picture and throughout the argument, we see that when 
<m>a,\ b,\ c,\ d\ge 0</m> and <m>b/a\ge d/c</m>, so that the vector <m>\llt c,d\rgt </m> 
lies below <m>\llt a,b\rgt </m>, the area of the parallelogram is <m>bc-ad</m>. 
In fact, all cases are covered by the formula
\begin{impeqn}xml:id="eq_pgram_area"
<md>
<mrow>
\text{area of parallelogram with sides <m>\llt a,b\rgt </m> and <m>\llt c,d\rgt =|ad-bc|</m>}
</mrow>
</md>
\end{impeqn}
</p>

<p>Given two vectors <m>\llt a,b\rgt </m> and <m>\llt c,d\rgt </m>, the expression 
<m>ad-bc</m> is generally written
<md>
<mrow>
\det\left[\begin{matrix}a&amp;b
</mrow><mrow> c&amp;d\end{matrix}\right]=ad-bc
</mrow>
</md>
and is called the <em>determinant</em> of the matrix
<fn>The topics of
matrices and determinants appear prominently in linear algebra courses. We
are only going to use them as notation, and we will explicitly explain
that notation. A linear algebra course is <em>not</em> a prerequisite 
for this text.</fn>

of a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix is the product of the diagonal entries 
minus the product of the off-diagonal entries. 
</p>

<p>There is a similar formula in three dimensions. Any three vectors

The determinant of a <m>3\times 3</m> matrix can be defined in terms
of some <m>2\times 2</m> determinants by
</p>

<p>      <image source="problems/figs/det2"/>
      This formula is called <q>expansion along the top row</q>. There
is one term in the formula for each entry in the top row of the <m>3\times 3</m>
matrix. The term is
a sign times the entry itself times the determinant of the <m>2\times 2</m> matrix
gotten by deleting the row and column that contains the entry. The sign
alternates, starting with a <m>+</m>. 
</p>

<p>We shall not prove this formula completely. It gets a little tedious.
But, there is one case in which we can easily verify that the volume of the 
parallelepiped is really given by the absolute value of the
claimed determinant. If the vectors <m>\vb</m> and <m>\vc</m> happen to lie
in the <m>xy</m> plane, so that <m>b_3=c_3=0</m>, then 
<md>
<mrow>
\det\left[\begin{matrix}a_1&amp;a_2&amp;a_3

</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=a_3(b_1c_2-b_2c_1)
</mrow>
</md>
The first factor, <m>a_3</m>, is the <m>z</m>-coordinate of the one vector not contained in the <m>xy</m>-plane. It 
is (up to a sign) the height of the parallelepiped. The second factor is,
up to a sign, the area of the parallelogram determined by <m>\vb</m>
and <m>\vc</m>. This parallelogram forms the base of the parallelepiped. 
The product is indeed, up to a sign, the volume of the parallelepiped.
That the formula is true in general is a consequence of the fact (that
we will not prove) that the value of a determinant does not change when
one rotates the coordinate system and that one can always rotate
our coordinate axes around so that <m>\vb</m> and <m>\vc</m> both lie in the
<m>xy</m>-plane. 
</p>

<p>\subsection{The Cross Product}
</p>

<p>We have already seen two different products involving vectors <mdash/>
the multiplication of a vector by a scalar 
and the dot product of two vectors. The dot product of two vectors
yields a scalar. We now introduce another product 
of two vectors, called the <em>cross product</em>. The cross product of
two vectors will give a vector. There are applications which have two 
vectors as inputs and produce one vector as an output, and which are related
to the cross product. Here is a very brief mention of two such applications. 
We will look at them in much more detail later. 
<ul>
<li> 
Consider a parallelogram in three dimensions.
A parallelogram is naturally determined by the two vectors that define 
its sides.
One measure of the size of a parallelogram is its area. 
One way to specify the orientation of the parallelogram is to give a vector
that is perpendicular to it. 
A very compact way to encode both the area and the orientation of
the parallelogram is to give a vector whose direction is perpendicular 
to the plane in which it lies and whose magnitude is its area.
We shall see that such a vector can be easily constructed by taking the cross product (definition coming shortly) of the two vectors that give
the sides of the parallelogram.
</p>


<sidebyside>

<p>
</li>
<li> 
Imagine a rigid body which is rotating at a rate <m>\Omega</m> radians per 
second about an axis whose direction is given by the unit vector <m>\hat\va</m>. 
Let <m>P</m> be any point on the body. We shall see, in the (optional)
\S<xref ref="sec_rot_motion"/>, that the velocity, <m>\vv</m>, of the point <m>P</m> 
is the cross product 
(again, definition coming shortly) of the vector <m>\Om\hat\va</m> with the vector
<m>\vr</m> from any point on the axis of rotation to <m>P</m>.
      </p>
<sidebyside> 
      <image source="problems/figs/rigidBB"/>
      </sidebyside>
<p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>\noindent
Finally, here is the definition of the cross product.
</p>

<p><definition><title>Cross Product</title>
<statement><p>xml:id="def_crossProd"
The cross product of the vectors <m>\va=\llt a_1,a_2,a_3\rgt</m> and 
<m>\vb=\llt b_1,b_2,b_3\rgt</m> is denoted <m>\va\times\vb</m> 
and is defined by
<md>
<mrow>
\va\times\vb = \llt a_2b_3-a_3b_2\,,\, a_3b_1-a_1b_3\,,\, a_1b_2-a_2b_1\rgt 
</mrow>
</md>
</p></statement>
</definition>
</p>

<p>Note that each component has the form <m>a_ib_j-a_jb_i</m>. The index <m>i</m> of
the first <m>a</m> in component number <m>k</m> of <m>\va\times\vb</m>
is just after <m>k</m> in the list <m>1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,\cdots</m>. 
The index <m>j</m> of the first <m>b</m> is just before <m>k</m> in the list. 
<md>
<mrow>
(\va\times\vb)_k
=a_{{\rm just\  after\  }k}\ b_{{\rm just\  before\  }k}
-a_{{\rm just\  before\  }k}\ b_{{\rm just\  after\  }k}
</mrow>
</md>
For example, for component number <m>k=3</m>,
<md>
<mrow>
\left.{\text{<q>just after 3</q> is 1}}\atop{\text{<q>just before 3</q> is 2}}\right\}
\implies (\va\times\vb)_3= a_1b_2-a_2b_1
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>There is a much better way to remember this definition. Recall that
a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix is an array of numbers having two rows and two columns
and that the determinant of a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix is  defined by
<md>
<mrow>
\det \left[\begin{matrix}a&amp; b
</mrow><mrow> c&amp;d\end{matrix}\right]=ad-bc
</mrow>
</md>
It is the product of the entries on the diagonal minus the product
of the entries not on the diagonal. 
</p>

<p>A <m>3\times 3</m> matrix is an array of
numbers having three rows and three columns.
<md>
<mrow>
 \left[\begin{matrix}i&amp; j &amp;k
</mrow><mrow> a_1&amp;a_2&amp;a_3\\ b_1&amp;b_2&amp;b_3\end{matrix}\right]
</mrow>
</md>
You will shortly see why the entries in the top row have been given the
rather peculiar names <m>i</m>, <m>j</m> and <m>k</m>. The determinant of a <m>3\times 3</m> 
matrix can be defined in terms of some <m>2\times 2</m> determinants by
      <image source="problems/figs/det.pdf"/>
      This formula is called <q>expansion of the determinant along the top row</q>. 
There is one term in the formula for each entry in the top row. The term is
a sign times the entry itself times the determinant of the <m>2\times 2</m> matrix
gotten by deleting the row and column that contains the entry. The sign
alternates, starting with a <m>+</m>. If we now replace <m>i</m> by <m>\hi</m>, <m>j</m> by <m>\hj</m> 
and <m>k</m> by <m>\hk</m>, we get exactly the formula for <m>\va\times \vb</m>
of Definition <xref ref="def_crossProd"/>. That is the reason for the peculiar 
choice of names for the matrix entries. So
<md>
<mrow>
\va\times\vb
&amp;=\det\left[\begin{matrix}\hi&amp; \hj &amp;\hk
</mrow><mrow> 
                            a_1&amp;a_2&amp;a_3
</mrow><mrow> 
                            b_1&amp;b_2&amp;b_3\end{matrix}\right] 
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\hi\big(a_2b_3-a_3b_2) -\hj(a_1b_3-a_3b_1) +\hk(a_1b_2-a_2b_1)
</mrow>
</md>
is a mnemonic device for remembering the definition of <m>\va\times\vb</m>.
It is also good from the point of view of 
evaluating <m>\va\times\vb</m>.
</p>

<p><example>
<p>xml:id="eg_GEOcrossijji"
In this example, we'll use the mnemonic device to compute two very simple cross
products. First
      <image source="problems/figs/detij.pdf"/>
      Second
      <image source="problems/figs/detji.pdf"/>
      Note that, unlike most (or maybe even all) products that you have seen before, <m>\hi\times\hj</m> is <em>not</em> the same as <m>\hj\times\hi</m>!
</p></example>
</p>

<p>Our first properties of the cross product 
lead up to a more intuitive geometric definition of <m>\va\times\vb</m>, which is better for interpreting <m>\va\times\vb</m>. 
 These properties of the cross product, which state that  <m>\va\times\vb</m>
is a vector and then determine its direction and length, are as follows.
We will collect these properties, and a few others, into a theorem shortly.

To see that <m>|\va|\,|\vb|\sin\theta</m> is the area of the parallelogram

These properties almost determine <m>\va\times\vb</m>. Property 1 forces

, which says
that if you form your right hand into a fist with your fingers curling from 
<m>\va</m> to <m>\vb</m>, then when you stick your thumb straight out from

<p>\textit{Outline of Proof}: We have already seen that the right hand side
has the correct length and, except possibly for a sign, direction.
To check that the right hand rule holds in
general, rotate your coordinate system around

If <m>(\va,\vb,\hn)</m> obey the right hand rule so do their rotated and

<m>y</m> component. That is <m>\va=\alpha\hi</m> and <m>\vb=\beta\hi+\gamma
\hj</m> with <m>\alpha,\gamma\ge 0</m>. Then 
<m>\va\times\vb=\alpha\hi\times(\beta\hi+\gamma\hj)
=\alpha\beta\,\hi\times\hi+\alpha\gamma\,\hi\times\hj</m>. The
first term vanishes by property 2, because the angle <m>\theta</m> between <m>\hi</m>
and <m>\hi</m> is zero. So, by property 3, 
<m>\va\times\vb= \alpha\gamma\hk</m> points
along the positive <m>z</m> axis, which is consistent with the right hand rule.

As an illustration of the properties of the dot and cross product, we now
derive the formula for the volume of the parallelepiped with edges 
<m>\va=\llt a_1,a_2,a_3\rgt </m>, <m>\vb = \llt b_1,b_2,b_3\rgt </m>, 
<m>\vc = \llt c_1,c_2,c_3\rgt </m> that was mentioned in

The volume of the parallelepiped is the area of its base times its 
height
<fn>This is a simple integral calculus exercise.</fn>
.
The base is the parallelogram with sides <m>\vb</m> and
<m>\vc</m>. Its area is the length of its base, which is <m>|\vb|</m>,
times its height, which is <m>|\vc|\,\sin\theta</m>. (Drop a 
perpendicular from the head of <m>\vc</m> to the line containing <m>\vb</m>). 
Here <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\vb</m> and <m>\vc</m>. So the area of the 
base is <m>|\vb|\,|\vc|\,\sin\theta= |\vb\times\vc|</m>, by 
property 2 of the cross product. To get the height of the parallelepiped, 
we drop a perpendicular from the head of <m>\va</m> to the line that passes 
through the tail of <m>\va</m> and is perpendicular to the base of the parallelepiped. In other words, from
the head of <m>\va</m> to the line that contains both the head and the tail
of <m>\vb\times\vc</m>. So the height of the parallelepiped is
<m>|\va|\,|\cos\varphi|</m>.  (The absolute values have been included because 
if the angle between <m>\vb\times\vc</m> and <m>\va</m> happens to be greater
than <m>90^\circ</m>, the <m>\cos\varphi</m> produced by taking the dot product of 
<m>\va</m> and  <m>(\vb\times\vc</m>) will be negative.) All together

Exchanging two rows in a determinant changes the sign of the determinant.
Moving the top row of a <m>3\times 3</m> determinant to the bottom row requires
two exchanges of rows.
So the two <m>3\times 3</m> determinants are equal.

<p>\subsection{(Optional) Application of Cross Products to Rotational Motion}
xml:id="sec_rot_motion"
</p>

<p>In most computations involving rotational motion, the cross product shows
up in one form or another. This is one of the main applications of the cross
product. Consider, for example, a rigid body which is rotating 
 at a constant rate of <m>\Omega</m> radians per second about an axis 
whose direction is given by the unit vector <m>\hat\va</m>. Let <m>P</m> be any point
on the body. Let's figure out its velocity. Pick any point on the axis
of rotation and designate it as the origin of our coordinate system. Denote
by <m>\vr</m> the vector from the origin to the point <m>P</m>. Let <m>\theta</m> denote
the angle between <m>\hat\va</m> and <m>\vr</m>. As time progresses the point <m>P</m>
sweeps out a circle of radius <m>R=|\vr\,|\sin\theta</m>.
      </p>
<sidebyside> 
      <image source="problems/figs/rigid"/>
      </sidebyside>
<p>
In one second <m>P</m> travels along an arc that subtends an angle of 
<m>\Omega</m> radians, which is the fraction <m>\tfrac{\Omega}{2\pi}</m> 
of a full circle.  The length of this arc is
<m>\tfrac{\Omega}{2\pi}\times 2\pi R=\Omega R=\Omega|\vr\,|\sin\theta</m> so <m>P</m> travels the distance <m>\Omega|\vr\,|\sin\theta</m>
in one second and its speed, which is also the length of its velocity vector,
is <m>\Omega|\vr\,|\sin\theta</m>. 
</p>

<p>Now we just need to figure out the direction
of the velocity vector. That is, the direction of motion of the point <m>P</m>.
Imagine that both <m>\hat\va</m> and <m>\vr</m> lie in the plane of a piece of paper, 
as in the figure above. Then <m>\vv</m> points either straight into 
or straight out of the page and consequently is perpendicular
to both <m>\hat\va</m> and <m>\vr</m>. To distinguish between the <q>into the page</q>
and <q>out of the page</q> cases, let's impose the conventions that 
<m>\Omega \gt 0</m> and the axis of rotation <m>\hat\va</m> is chosen to obey the right hand
 rule, meaning that if the thumb of
your right hand is pointing in the direction <m>\hat\va</m>, then your fingers
are pointing in the direction of motion of the rigid body.  Under these
conventions, the velocity vector <m>\vv</m> obeys
<ul>
<li> <m>|\vv|=\Omega|\vr||\hat\va|\sin\theta</m>
</li>
<li> <m>\vv\perp\hat\va,\vr</m>
</li>
<li> <m>(\hat\va,\vr,\vv)</m> obey the right hand rule
</li>
</ul>
That is, <m>\vv</m> is exactly <m>\Omega\hat\va\times\vr</m>. It is conventional
to define the <q>angular velocity</q> of a rigid body to be vector
<m>\mathbf{\Omega}=\Omega\hat\va</m>. That is, the vector with length given 
by the rate of rotation and direction given by the axis of rotation 
of the rigid body. In particular, the bigger the rate of rotation, the longer
the angular velocity vector. In terms of this angular 
velocity vector, the velocity of the point <m>P</m> is

<p>\subsection{(Optional) Application of Cross Products to Rotating Reference Frames}xml:id="sec_rot_frame"
</p>

<p>Imagine a moving particle that is being tracked by two observers.
<ol label="a">
<li> One observer is fixed (out in space) and measures the position of 
  the particle to be <m>\big(X(t), Y(t), Z(t)\big)</m>.
</li>
<li> The other observer is tied to a merry-go-round (the Earth) and 
  measures the position of the particle to be <m>\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)</m>.
</li>
</ol>
The merry-go-round is sketched in the figure on the left below. It
is rotating about the <m>Z</m>-axis at a (constant) rate of <m>\Omega</m> radians per second.
The vector <m>\vOmega = \Omega \hk</m>, whose length is the rate of rotation and
whose direction is the axis of rotation, is called the angular velocity.

The <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes of the moving observer are painted in red on
the merry-go-round. The figure on the right above shows a top view of the
merry-go-round. The <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes of the moving observer are again
red. The <m>X</m>- and <m>Y</m>-axes of the fixed observer are blue.  We are
assuming that at time <m>0</m>, the <m>x</m>-axis of the moving observer and 
the <m>X</m>-axis of the fixed observer coincide. As the merry-go-round
is rotating at <m>\Om</m> radians per second, the angle between the <m>X</m>-axis
and <m>x</m>-axis after <m>t</m> seconds is <m>\Omega t</m>.

On a rotating ball, such as the Earth, the Coriolis force deflects
wind to the right (counterclockwise) in the northern hemisphere
and to the left (clockwise) is the southern hemisphere. In particular,
hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons rotate counterclockwise in the northern
hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. On the other
hand, when it comes to water draining out of, for example, a toilet,
Coriolis force effects are dominated by other factors like asymmetry 
of the toilet.

<p>A line in two dimensions can be specified  by giving one point

If <m>(x,y)</m> is any point on the line then the vector <m>\llt x-x_0,y-y_0\rgt </m>, 
whose tail is at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and whose head is at <m>(x,y)</m>,  must be parallel
to <m>\vd</m> and hence must be a scalar multiple of <m>\vd</m>. So

These are called the parametric equations of the line, because they contain
a free parameter, namely <m>t</m>. As <m>t</m> varies from <m>-\infty</m> to <m>\infty</m>,
the point <m>(x_0+td_x,y_0+td_y)</m> traverses the entire line.
</p>

<p>It is easy to eliminate the parameter <m>t</m> from the equations. Just 
multiply <m>x-x_0=t d_x</m> by <m>d_y</m>, multiply <m>y-y_0=t d_y</m> by <m>d_x</m>
and subtract to give

(x-x_0)d_y-(y-y_0)d_x=0

In the event that <m>d_x</m> and <m>d_y</m> are both nonzero, we can rewrite this

Observe that the coefficients <m>n_x,n_y</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the equation
of the line are the components of a vector <m>\llt n_x,n_y\rgt </m> perpendicular 
to the line. This enables us to read off a vector perpendicular to any
given line directly from the equation of the line. Such a vector is called 
a normal vector for the line. 
<example>
<p>
Consider, for example, the line <m>y=3x+7</m>. To rewrite this equation in the form 
<me>
n_xx+n_yy= n_xx_0+n_yy_0
</me> 
we have to move terms around so that <m>x</m> and
<m>y</m> are on one side of the equation and <m>7</m> is  on the other side:
 <m>3x-y=-7</m>. Then <m>n_x</m> is the coefficient of <m>x</m>, namely <m>3</m>, and <m>n_y</m>
is the coefficient of <m>y</m>, namely <m>-1</m>. One normal vector
for <m>y=3x+7</m> is <m>\llt 3,-1\rgt </m>. 
</p>

<p>Of course, if <m>\llt 3,-1\rgt </m> is perpendicular to <m>y=3x+7</m>, so is 
<m>-5\llt 3,-1\rgt =\llt -15,5\rgt </m>.
In fact, if we first multiply the equation <m>3x-y=-7</m> by <m>-5</m> to
get <m>-15x+5y=35</m> and then set <m>n_x</m> and <m>n_y</m> to the coefficients of <m>x</m>
and <m>y</m> respectively, we get <m>\vn=\llt -15,5\rgt </m>.

In this example, we find the point on the line <m>y=6-3x</m> (call the line <m>L</m>)

<p>We'll start by sketching the line. 
To do so, we guess two points on <m>L</m> and then draw the line that passes 
through the two points.
<ul>
<li>  If <m>(x,y)</m> is on <m>L</m> and <m>x=0</m>, then <m>y=6</m>. So <m>(0,6)</m> is

<p>Specifying one point <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> on a plane and a vector <m>\vd</m> parallel

        }
on the plane and one vector <m>\vn=\llt n_x,n_y, n_z\rgt </m> with direction 
perpendicular to that of the plane does uniquely determine the plane.
If <m>(x,y,z)</m> is any point on the line then the vector 
<m>\llt x-x_0,y-y_0,z-z_0\rgt </m>,
whose tail is at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> and whose head is at <m>(x,y,z)</m>,  lies
entirely inside the plane and so must be perpendicular to <m>\vn</m>. That is,
\begin{impeqn}[The Equation of a Plane]xml:id="eqn_of_plane"
<md>
<mrow>
  \vn\cdot\llt x-x_0,y-y_0,z-z_0\rgt =0

</md>
where <m>d=n_xx_0+n_yy_0+n_zz_0</m>.
\end{impeqn}\noindent
Again, the coefficients <m>n_x,n_y,n_z</m> of <m>x,\ y</m> and <m>z</m> in the equation
of the plane are the components of a vector <m>\llt n_x,n_y,n_z\rgt </m> 
perpendicular to the plane. The vector <m>\vn</m> is often called a normal vector
for the plane. Any nonzero multiple of <m>\vn</m> will also be perpendicular
to the plane and is also called a normal vector.
</p>

<p><example>
<p>xml:id="eg_VPparallel-normal-Planes"
We have just seen that if we write the equation of a plane in the standard
form 
<me>
ax+by+cz=d
</me> 
then it is easy to read off a normal vector for the plane.
It is just <m>\llt a,b,c\rgt</m>. So for example the planes
<me>
P:\ x+2y+3z=4 \qquad
P':\ 3x+6y+9z=7
</me>
have normal vectors <m>\vn=\llt 1,2,3\rgt</m> and <m>\vn'=\llt 3,6,9\rgt</m>, 
respectively. Since <m>\vn'=3\vn</m>, the two normal vectors <m>\vn</m> and <m>\vn'</m> 
are parallel to each other. This tells us that the planes <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m> 
are parallel to each other.
</p>

<p>When the normal vectors of two planes are perpendicular to each other,
we say that 
the planes are perpendicular to each other. For example
the planes 
<me>
P:\ x+2y+3z=4 \qquad
P</q>:\ 2x-y=7
</me>
have normal vectors  <m>\vn=\llt 1,2,3\rgt</m> and <m>\vn</q>=\llt 2,-1,0\rgt</m>, 
respectively. Since
<me>
\vn\cdot\vn</q> = 1\times 2+2\times(-1)+3\times 0 = 0
</me>
the normal vectors <m>\vn</m> and <m>\vn</q></m> are mutually perpendicular,
so the corresponding planes <m>P</m> and <m>P</q></m> are perpendicular to each other.
</p></example>
\goodbreak
</p>

<p><example>
<p>xml:id="eg_VPsketchPlane"
In this example, we'll sketch the plane 
<me>
P:\ 4x + 3y + 2z = 12
</me>
A good way to prepare for sketching a plane is to find the intersection 
points of the plane with the <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-axes, just as you are used 
to doing when sketching lines in the <m>xy</m>-plane. For example, 
any point on the <m>x</m> axis must be of the form <m>(x,0,0)</m>. For <m>(x,0,0)</m> 
to also be on <m>P</m> we need <m>x=\frac{12}{4}=3</m>. So <m>P</m> intersects 
the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>(3,0,0)</m>. Similarly, <m>P</m> intersects the <m>y</m>-axis 
at <m>(0,4,0)</m> and the <m>z</m>-axis at <m>(0,0,6)</m>. Now plot the points 
<m>(3,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,4,0)</m> and <m>(0,0,6)</m>. <m>P</m> is the plane containing these 
three points. 
Often a visually effective way to sketch a surface in three dimensions
is to 
<ul>
<li> only sketch the part of the surface in the first octant. That is,
the part with <m>x\ge0</m>, <m>y\ge 0</m> and <m>z\ge 0</m>.
</li>
<li> To do so, sketch the curve of intersection of the surface with
the part of the <m>xy</m>-plane in the first octant and,
</li>
<li> similarly, sketch the curve of intersection of the surface with
the part of the <m>xz</m>-plane in the first octant and
the curve of intersection of the surface with
the part of the <m>yz</m>-plane in the first octant.
</li>
</ul>
That's what we'll do. The intersection of the plane <m>P</m> with the <m>xy</m>-plane
is the straight line through the two points <m>(3,0,0)</m> and <m>(0,4,0)</m>. So
the part of that intersection in the first octant is the line segment
from <m>(3,0,0)</m> to <m>(0,4,0)</m>. Similarly the part of the intersection of
<m>P</m> with the <m>xz</m>-plane that is in the first octant is the line segment
from <m>(3,0,0)</m> to <m>(0,0,6)</m> and  the part of the intersection of
<m>P</m> with the <m>yz</m>-plane that is in the first octant is the line segment
from <m>(0,4,0)</m> to <m>(0,0,6)</m>. So we just have to sketch the three line segments
joining three axis intercepts <m>(3,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,4,0)</m> and <m>(0,0,6)</m>.
That's it.

<p>xml:id="eg_VPdistance-point-plane"
In this example, we'll compute the distance between the point
<me>
\vx = (1,-1,-3) \qquad\text{and the plane}\qquad
P:\ x+2y+3z=18
</me>
By the <q>distance between <m>\vx</m> and the plane <m>P</m></q> we mean the shortest
distance between <m>\vx</m> and any point <m>\vy</m> on <m>P</m>. In fact, we'll evaluate the
distance in two different ways. In the next 
Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-point-plane-bis"/>, we'll use projection.
In this example, our strategy for finding the distance will be to
<ul>
<li> first observe that the vector <m>\vn=\llt 1,2,3\rgt</m> is normal to <m>P</m> 
and then
</li>
<li> start walking
<fn>To see why heading in the normal direction gives
the shortest walk, revisit Example <xref ref="eg_nearest_point"/>.</fn>
 away from <m>\vx</m> 
in the  direction of the normal vector <m>\vn</m> and
</li>
<li> keep walking until we hit <m>P</m>. Call the point on <m>P</m> where we hit,
<m>\vy</m>. Then the desired distance is the distance between <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m>.
From the figure below it does indeed look like distance between <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m>
is the shortest distance between <m>\vx</m> and any point on <m>P</m>. This is in 
fact true, though we won't prove it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So imagine that we start walking, and that we start at time <m>t=0</m> at <m>\vx</m> 
and walk in the direction <m>\vn</m>. Then at time <m>t</m> we might be at
<me>
\vx+t\vn = (1,-1,-3) +t\,\llt 1,2,3\rgt
         = (1+t, -1+2t, -3+3t)
</me>
We hit the plane <m>P</m> at exactly the time <m>t</m> for which 
<m>(1+t, -1+2t, -3+3t)</m> satisfies the equation for <m>P</m>, which is 
<m>x+2y+3z=18</m>. So we are on <m>P</m> at the unique time <m>t</m> obeying

We are again going to find the distance from the point 
<me>
\vx = (1,-1,-3) \qquad\text{to the plane}\qquad
P:\ x+2y+3z=18
</me>
But this time we will use the following strategy.
<ul>
<li> We'll first find any point <m>\vz</m> on <m>P</m> and then
</li>
<li> we'll denote by <m>\vy</m> the point on <m>P</m> nearest <m>\vx</m>, and we'll 
   denote by <m>\vv</m> the vector from <m>\vx</m> to <m>\vz</m> (see the figure below)
   and then
</li>
<li> we'll realize, by looking at the figure, that the vector from <m>\vx</m> 
to <m>\vy</m> is exactly the projection
<fn>Now might be a good time to review 
the Definition <xref ref="def_projection"/> of projection.</fn>
 of the vector <m>\vv</m> on <m>\vn</m> so that
</li>
<li> the distance from <m>\vx</m> to <m>P</m>, i.e. the length of the vector 
from <m>\vx</m> to <m>\vy</m>, is exactly <m>\left|\text{proj}_\vn\vv \right|</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/pointDistProj.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
Now let's find a point on <m>P</m>. The plane <m>P</m> is given by a single equation,
namely 
<me>
x+2y+3z=18
</me> 
in the three unknowns, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>. The easiest way
to find one solution to this equation is to assign two of the unknowns
the value zero and then solve for the third unknown. For example, if we
set <m>x=y=0</m>, then the equation reduces to <m>3z=18</m>. So we may take
<m>\vz=(0,0,6)</m>.
</p>

<p>Then <m>\vv</m>, the vector from <m>\vx=(1,-1,-3)</m> to <m>\vz=(0,0,6)</m> is
<m>\llt 0-1\,,\,0-(-1)\,,\,6-(-3)  \rgt=\llt -1,1,9\rgt</m> so that,

<mrow>
\left|{\rm proj}_{\vn}\,\vv\right| = \big|2 \llt 1,2,3\rgt\big|

just as we found in Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-point-plane"/>.
</p></example>
</p>

<p><example>
<p>xml:id="eg_VPdistance-Planes"
Now we'll increase the degree of difficulty a tiny bit, and compute 
the distance between the planes
<me>
P:\ x+2y+2z=1 \qquad\text{and}\qquad
P':\ 2x+4y+4z=11
</me>
By the <q>distance between the planes <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m></q> we mean the shortest
   distance between any pair of points <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> with <m>\vx</m> in <m>P</m>
   and <m>\vx'</m> in <m>P'</m>.
First observe that the normal vectors
<me>
\vn=\llt 1,2,2\rgt \qquad\text{and}\qquad
\vn'=\llt 2,4,4\rgt=2\vn
</me>
to <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m> are parallel to each other. So the planes <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m> 
are parallel to each other.
</p>

<p>If they had not been parallel, they would have crossed
and the distance between them would have been zero. 
</p>

<p>Our strategy for finding the distance will be to
<ul>
<li> first find a point <m>\vx</m> on <m>P</m> and then, like we did in Example
<xref ref="eg_VPdistance-point-plane"/>,
</li>
<li> start walking away from <m>P</m> in the 
direction of the normal vector <m>\vn</m> and
</li>
<li> keep walking until we hit <m>P'</m>. Call the point on <m>P'</m> that we hit
<m>\vx'</m>. Then the desired distance is the distance between <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m>.
From the figure below it does indeed look like distance between <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m>
is the shortest distance between any pair of points with one point on <m>P</m> and
one point on <m>P'</m>. Again, this is in fact true, though we won't prove it.

We can find a point on <m>P</m> just as we did on Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-point-plane-bis"/>. The plane <m>P</m> is given by the single equation

in the three unknowns, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>. We can find one solution to this

solving for the third unknown. For example, if we
set <m>y=z=0</m>, then the equation reduces to <m>x=1</m>. So we may take
<m>\vx=(1,0,0)</m>.
</p>

<p>Now imagine that we start walking, and that we start at time <m>t=0</m> at <m>\vx</m> 
and walk in the direction <m>\vn</m>. Then at time <m>t</m> we might be at

whose tail is at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> and whose arrow is at <m>(x,y,z)</m>,  must be
parallel to <m>\vd</m> and hence a scalar multiple of <m>\vd</m>. By translating

 The set of points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that obey both <m>x+y+z=2</m> and <m>x-y=0</m>  lie

</p>

<p>To sketch <m>x+y+z=2</m> we observe

So <m>(1,1,0)</m> is on the line. Now we'll find a direction vector, <m>\vd</m>,
for the line. Since the line is contained in the plane <m>x+y+z=2</m>,
any vector lying on the line, like <m>\vd</m>, is also completely contained
in that plane. So <m>\vd</m> must be perpendicular to the normal vector of
<m>x+y+z=2</m>, which is <m>\llt 1,1,1\rgt </m>. Similarly, since the line is 
contained in the plane <m>x-y=0</m>, any vector lying on the line, like <m>\vd</m>, is also completely contained in that plane.  So <m>\vd</m> must be perpendicular to 
the normal vector of <m>x-y=0</m>, which is <m>\llt 1,-1,0\rgt </m>. So we may choose for
<m>\vd</m> any vector which is perpendicular to both <m>\llt 1,1,1\rgt </m> and 
<m>\llt 1,-1,0\rgt</m>, like, for example,

We now have both a point on the line and a direction vector for the line,

This looks a little different than the solution from method 1, but we'll see in a moment that they are really the same. Before that, let's do one more method. 
</p>

<p>\smallskip
\noindent<em>Method 3.</em> We'll find two points on the line. We
have already found that <m>(1,1,0)</m> is on the line. From the picture above,
it looks like <m>(0,0,2)</m> is also on the line. This is indeed the case
since <m>(0,0,2)</m> obeys both <m>x+y+z=2</m> and <m>x-y=0</m>. Notice that we could also have
guessed <m>(0,0,2)</m> by setting <m>x=0</m>  and then solving <m>y+z=x+y+z=2</m>, <m>-y=x-y=0</m>
for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. As both <m>(1,1,0)</m>
and <m>(0,0,2)</m> are on the line, the vector with head at <m>(1,1,0)</m> and tail
at <m>(0,0,2)</m>, which is <m>\llt 1-0,1-0,0-2\rgt =\llt 1,1,-2\rgt </m>, is a direction vector for the 
line. As <m>(0,0,2)</m> is a point on the line and <m>\llt 1,1,-2\rgt </m> is a direction
vector for the line, the parametric equations for the line are
<md>
<mrow>
\llt x-0,y-0,z-2\rgt =t\llt 1,1,-2\rgt \qquad\text{or}\qquad
x=t,\ y=t,\ z=2-2t
</mrow>
</md>
This also looks similar, but not quite identical, to our previous answers.
Time for a comparison.
</p>

<p>\smallskip
\noindent<em>Comparing the answers.</em>
The parametric equations given by the three methods are different. That's
just because we have really used different parameters in the three methods,
even though we have called the parameter <m>t</m> in each case. 
To clarify the relation
between the three answers, rename the parameter of method 1 to <m>t_1</m>,
the parameter of method 2 to <m>t_2</m> and the parameter of method 3 to <m>t_3</m>.
The parametric equations then become
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>{6}
&amp;\text{Method 1:}\qquad &amp;

</md>  
Substituting <m>t_1=2t_2</m> into the Method 1 equations gives the Method 2
equations, and substituting <m>t_3=1-t_2</m> into the Method 3 equations gives 
the Method 2 equations. So all three really give the same line, just parametrized a little differently,

In this example, we find the distance between the point <m>(2,3,-1)</m> and the line

The vector from <m>(2,3,-1)</m> to the point <m>(1+t\,,\,2+t\,,\,3+2t)</m> on <m>L</m> is
<m>
\llt t-1\,,\,t-1\,,\,2t+4\rgt</m>.
The square of the distance between <m>(2,3,-1)</m> and the point 
<m>(1+t\,,\,2+t\,,\,3+2t)</m>  on <m>L</m> is the square of the length of that vector, namely
<me>
d(t)^2 = (t-1)^2 +(t-1)^2 +(2t+4)^2
</me>
The point on <m>L</m> that is closest to <m>(2,3,-1)</m> is that whose value of <m>t</m>
obeys

</p>

<p>Before we solve this equation for <m>t</m> and finish of our computation, observe
that this equation (divided by <m>2</m>) says that

That is, <em>the vector from <m>(2,3,-1)</m> to the point on <m>L</m> nearest <m>(2,3,-1)</m>

</p>

<p>Now back to our computation. The equation <m>(*)</m> simplifies to <m>12t+12=0</m>.
So the optimal <m>t=-1</m> and the distance is

<p>
xml:id="eg_VPdistance-point-line-bis"
In this example, we again find the distance between the point <m>(2,3,-1)</m> 
and the line
<me>
L:\  \llt x-1,y-2,z-3\rgt=t\llt 1,1,2\rgt
</me>
but we use a different method. In the figure below, <m>Q</m> is the point <m>(2,3,-1)</m>. 
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/pointDistProjB.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
If we drop a perpendicular from <m>Q</m> to the line <m>L</m>, it hits the line <m>L</m> 
at the point <m>N</m>, which is the point on <m>L</m> that is nearest <m>Q</m>. So 
the distance from <m>Q</m> to <m>L</m> is exactly the distance from <m>Q</m> to <m>N</m>, which 
is exactly the length of the vector from <m>Q</m> to <m>N</m>. In the figure above,
<m>\vw</m> is the vector from <m>Q</m> to <m>N</m>. Now the vector <m>\vw</m> has to be perpendicular to the direction vector for <m>L</m>. That is,  <m>\vw</m> has to be perpendicular to <m>\vd=\llt 1,1,2\rgt</m>. However, as we saw in Warning
<xref ref="warn_line_normal"/>, there are a huge number of vectors in different 
directions that are perpendicular to <m>\vd</m>. So you might think that it is very hard to even determine the direction of <m>\vw</m>. 
</p>

<p>Fortunately, it isn't. Here is the strategy.
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li> 
Pick any point on <m>L</m> and call it <m>P</m>.
</li>
<li>
It is very easy to find the vector from <m>P</m> to <m>N</m> <mdash/> it is just the projection of the vector from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> (called <m>\vv</m> in the figure above)
on <m>\vd</m>.
</li>
<li>
Once we know <m>{\rm proj}_{\vd}\,\vv</m>, we will be able to compute
<me>
\vw = {\rm proj}_{\vd}\,\vv -\vv
</me>
</li>
<li>
and then the distance from <m>Q</m> to the line <m>L</m> is just <m>|\vw|</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Here is the computation. We'll choose <m>P</m> to be the point on <m>L</m> that has 
<m>t=0</m>, which is <m>(1,2,3)</m>. So the vector from <m>P=(1,2,3)</m> to <m>Q=(2,3,-1)</m> is
<me>
\vv = \llt 2-1,3-2,-1-3\rgt=\llt 1,1,-4\rgt
</me>
The projection of <m>\vv=\llt 1,1,-4\rgt</m> on <m>\vd=\llt 1,1,2\rgt</m> is
<me>
{\rm proj}_{\vd}\,\vv
=\frac{\llt 1,1,-4\rgt\cdot\llt 1,1,2\rgt}{|\llt 1,1,2\rgt|^2}\llt 1,1,2\rgt
=\frac{-6}{6}\llt 1,1,2\rgt
=\llt -1,-1,-2\rgt
</me>
and then
<me>
\vw = {\rm proj}_{\vd}\,\vv -\vv
    = \llt -1,-1,-2\rgt -\llt 1,1,-4\rgt
    = \llt -2,-2,2\rgt
</me>
and finally the distance from <m>Q</m> to the  line <m>L</m> is
<me>
|\vw| = |\llt -2,-2,2\rgt|
      =|2\llt -1,-1,1\rgt|
      =2\sqrt{3}

Of course the value of <m>t</m> in the parametric equation for <m>L</m> need not be 
the same as the value of <m>t</m> in the parametric equation for <m>L'</m>. So 
let us denote by <m>\vx(s) = (1+s\,,\,2\,,\,3-s)</m> and 
<m>\vy(t) = (1+t\,,\,2-2t\,,\,1+t)</m> 
the points on <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m>, respectively, that are closest together. 
Note that the vector from <m>\vx(s)</m> to <m>\vy(t)</m> is
<m>\llt  t-s\,,\,-2t\,,\,-2+s+t \rgt</m>. Then, in particular,

the vector, <m>\llt  t-s\,,\,-2t\,,\,-2+s+t \rgt</m>, that joins <m>\vx(s)</m> and <m>\vy(t)</m>, must be perpendicular to both the direction vector of <m>L</m> and the

this time using a projection, much as in 
Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-point-plane-bis"/>. The procedure,
which will be justified below, is
<ul>
<li>
first form a vector <m>\vn</m> that is perpendicular to the direction vectors
of both lines by taking the cross product of the two direction vectors.
In this example,

</md>
Since we just want <m>\hn</m> to be perpendicular to both direction vectors,
we may simplify our computations by dividing this vector by <m>-2</m>, and take
<m>\vn = \llt 1,1,1 \rgt</m>.
</li>
<li>
Next find one point on <m>L</m> and one point on <m>L'</m> and subtract to form a 
vector <m>\vv</m> whose tail is at one point and whose head is at the 
other point. This vector goes from one line to the other line. In this example,
the point <m>(1,2,3)</m> is on <m>L</m> (just set <m>t=0</m> in the equation for <m>L</m>) and the point <m>(1,2,1)</m> is on <m>L'</m> (just set <m>t=0</m> in the equation for <m>L'</m>),
so that we may take
<me>
\vv = \llt 1-1\,,\,2-2\,,\,3-1\rgt = \llt 0,0,2 \rgt
</me>
</li>
<li>
The distance between the two lines is the length of the projection of <m>\vv</m>

<md>

</md> 
just as we found in Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-line-line"/>
</li>
</ul>
Now, here is the justification for the procedure. 
<ul>
<li>
As we did in Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-line-line"/>, denote by
<m>\vx(s)</m> and <m>\vy(t)</m> the points on <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m>, respectively, 
that are closest together. Note that, as we observed in 
Example <xref ref="eg_VPdistance-line-line"/>, the vector from <m>\vx(s)</m> to <m>\vy(t)</m>
is perpendicular to the direction vectors of both lines, and so is parallel 
to <m>\vn</m>.
</li>
<li>
Denote by <m>P</m> the plane through <m>\vx(s)</m> that is perpendicular to <m>\vn</m>.
As <m>\vx(s)</m> is on <m>L</m> and the direction vector of <m>L</m> is perpendicular to
<m>\vn</m>, the line <m>L</m> is contained in <m>P</m>.
</li>
<li>
Denote by <m>P'</m> the plane through <m>\vy(t)</m> that is perpendicular to <m>\vn</m>.
As <m>\vy(t)</m> is on <m>L'</m> and the direction vector of <m>L'</m> is perpendicular to
<m>\vn</m>, the line <m>L'</m> is contained in <m>P'</m>.
</li>
<li>
The planes <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m> are parallel to each other. As <m>\vx(s)</m> is on <m>P</m>
and <m>\vy(t)</m> is on <m>P'</m>, and the vector from <m>\vx(s)</m> to <m>\vy(t)</m> 
is perpendicular to both <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m>, the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>P'</m>  
is exactly the length of the vector from <m>\vx(s)</m> to <m>\vy(t)</m>.
That is also the distance from <m>L</m> to <m>L'</m>.
</li>
<li>
The vector <m>\vv</m> constructed in the procedure above is a vector between <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> and so is also a vector between <m>P</m> and <m>P'</m>. Looking at the figure
below
<fn>and possibly reviewing the Definition <xref ref="def_projection"/>
of projection</fn>
, we see that the vector from <m>\vx(s)</m> to <m>\vy(t)</m> is 
(up to a sign) the projection of <m>\vv</m> on <m>\vn</m>. 
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/planeDistB.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
</li>
<li> 
So the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>P'</m>, and hence the distance from <m>L</m> to <m>L'</m>,
is exactly the length of <m>{\rm proj}_{\vn}\vv</m>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>\section{Curves and their Tangent Vectors}xml:id="sec_curves"
</p>

<p>The right hand side of the parametric equation 
 <m>(x,y,z)=(1,1,0)+t\llt 1,2,-2\rgt</m> that we just saw in Warning 
<xref ref="warn_line_normal"/> is a vector-valued function of the one real 
variable <m>t</m>.
We are now going to study more general vector-valued functions of one 
real variable. That is, we are going to study functions that assign to 
each real number <m>t</m> (typically in some interval) a vector <m>\vr(t)</m>. 
For example
<me>
\vr(t) = \big( x(t), y(t), z(t)\big)
</me>
might be the position of a particle at time <m>t</m>. As <m>t</m> varies
<m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out a curve.
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/parCurve.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
While in some applications <m>t</m> will indeed be <q>time</q>, it does not
have to be. It can be simply a parameter that is used to label the
different points on the curve that <m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out. We then say 
that <m>\vr(t)</m> provides a parametrization of the curve.
</p>

<p><example>
<p>xml:id="eg_paramCircle"
While we will often use <m>t</m> as the parameter in a parametrized curve <m>\vr(t)</m>,
there is no need to call it <m>t</m>. Sometimes it is natural to use a different 
name for the parameter. For example, consider the circle <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>.
It is natural to use the angle <m>\theta</m> in the sketch below to label
the point <m>\big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)</m> on the circle. 
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/parCircle.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
That is,
<me>
\vr(\theta) = \big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)\qquad
0\le \theta\le 2\pi
</me>
is a parametrization of the circle <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>. Just looking at the figure above, it is clear that, as <m>\theta</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>2\pi</m>, <m>\vr(\theta)</m>
traces out the full circle. 
</p>

<p>However beware that just knowing that 
<m>\vr(t)</m> lies on a specified curve does not guarantee that, as <m>t</m> varies,
<m>\vr(t)</m> covers the entire curve. For example, as <m>t</m> runs over the whole
real line, <m>\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(t)</m> runs over the interval <m>(-1,1)</m>.
For all <m>t</m>,
<me>
\vr(t) = \big(x(t),y(t)\big) 
       = a\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(t)\,,\,
                \sqrt{1-\frac{4}{\pi^2}\arctan^2(t)}\,\right)
</me>
is well-defined and obeys <m>x(t)^2+y(t)^2=a^2</m>. But this <m>\vr(t)</m> does not
cover the entire circle because <m>y(t)</m> is always positive.
</p>

</example>
</p>

<p>Curves often arise as the intersection of two surfaces. For example,
the intersection of the sphere <m>x^2+y^2+z^2=1</m>
with the plane <m>y=x</m> is a circle. The part of that circle that is
in the first octant is the red curve in the figure below.
\vadjust{
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/spherePlane.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
}
One way to parametrize such curves is to
choose one of the three coordinates <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> as the parameter,
and solve the two given equations for the remaining two coordinates,
as functions of the parameter. Here are two examples.

<p>\subsection{Derivatives and Tangent Vectors}xml:id="sec_curve_derivs"
</p>

<p>This being a Calculus text, one of our main operations is differentiation.
We are now interested in parametrizations <m>\vr(t)</m>.
It is very easy and natural to extend our definition of derivative to <m>\vr(t)</m>
as follows.
</p>

<p><definition>
<statement><p>xml:id="def__curve_deriv"
The derivative of the vector valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> is defined to be
<me>
\vr'(t) =  \diff{\vr}{t}(t)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}
\qquad
\raisebox{-25pt}[25pt][20pt]{<image source="problems/figs/parCurveDerivA.pdf"/>}
</me>
when the limit exists. In particular, if 
<m>\vr(t)=\big(x(t)\,,\,y(t)\,,\,z(t)\big)</m>, then
<me>
\vr'(t)=\big(x'(t)\,,\,y'(t)\,,\,z'(t)\big)
</me>
That is, to differentiate a vector valued function of <m>t</m>, just differentiate
each of its components.
</p></statement>
</definition>
</p>

<p>And of course differentiation interacts with arithmetic operations, 
like addition, in the obvious way. Only a little more thought is required to 
see that differentiation interacts quite nicely with dot and cross 
products too.

<p>Let's think about the geometric significance of <m>\vr'(t)</m>.
In particular, let's think about the relationship between <m>\vr'(t)</m>

The derivative <m>\vr'(t)</m> is the limit of   <m>\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}</m> as <m>h\rightarrow 0</m>. 
The numerator, <m>\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)</m>, is the vector with head at <m>\vr(t+h)</m>

<p>\section{Sketching Surfaces in 3d}xml:id="sec_sketching"
</p>

<p>In practice students taking multivariable calculus regularly have great
difficulty visualising surfaces in three dimensions, despite the fact
that we all live in three dimensions. We'll now develop some
technique to help us sketch surfaces in three dimensions
<fn>Of course you could instead use some fancy graphing software, but part of the point is to
build intuition. Not to mention that you can't use fancy graphing software on 
your exam.</fn>
.
</p>

<p>We all have a fair
bit of experience drawing curves in two dimensions. Typically the intersection
of a surface (in three dimensions) with a plane is a curve lying in 
the (two dimensional) plane. Such an intersection is usually called a cross-section.
In the special case that the plane is one of the coordinate planes, the
intersection is sometimes called a trace. One can often get a pretty good
idea of what a surface looks like by sketching a bunch of cross-sections.
Here are some examples.
</p>

<p>\bigskip
<example><title><m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m></title>
<p>xml:id="eg_hyperboloid"
\medskip
Sketch the surface that satisfies <m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m>.
</p>

<p>\soln We'll start by fixing any number <m>z_0</m> and sketching the part of
the surface that lies in the horizontal plane <m>z=z_0</m>. 
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/zedzeroPlane.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
The intersection of our surface with that horizontal plane is a horizontal
cross-section. Any point <m>(x,y,z)</m> lying on that horizontal cross-section
satisfies both 
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;z=z_0\text{\ \ and\ \ }4x^2+y^2-z^2=1 
</mrow><mrow>
\iff
&amp;z=z_0\text{\  \ and\ \ }4x^2+y^2=1+z_0^2
</mrow>
</md>
Think of <m>z_0</m> as a constant.
Then <m>4x^2+y^2=1+z_0^2</m> is a curve in the <m>xy</m>-plane. As <m>1+z_0^2</m> is a constant, the curve is an ellipse. To determine its semi-axes
<fn>The
semi-axes of an ellipse are the line segments from the centre of the ellipse
to the farthest point on the curve and to the nearest point on the curve.
For a circle the lengths of both of these line segments are just the  radius.</fn>
, we observe that
when <m>y=0</m>, we have <m>x=\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+z_0^2}</m> and when <m>x=0</m>,
we have <m>y=\pm\sqrt{1+z_0^2}</m>. So the curve is just an ellipse with 
<m>x</m> semi-axis <m>\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+z_0^2}</m> and <m>y</m> semi-axis 
<m>\sqrt{1+z_0^2}</m>. It's easy to sketch.
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/ellipse.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
Remember that this ellipse is the part of our surface that lies in the
plane <m>z=z_0</m>. Imagine that the sketch of the ellipse is on a single
sheet of paper. Lift the sheet of paper up, move it around so that 
the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes point in the directions of the three dimensional 
<m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes and place the sheet of paper into the three 
dimensional sketch at height <m>z_0</m>.
This gives a single horizontal ellipse in 3d, as in the figure below.
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/hyperboloidZX.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
We can build up the full surface by stacking many of these horizontal 
ellipses <mdash/> one for each possible height <m>z_0</m>. 
So we now draw a few of them as in the figure below. To reduce the 
amount of clutter in the sketch, we have only drawn the first octant 
(i.e. the part of three dimensions that has <m>x\ge 0</m>, <m>y\ge 0</m> and <m>z\ge 0</m>). 
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/hyperboloidZXB.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>


<p>Here is why it is OK, in this case, to just sketch the first octant.
Replacing <m>x</m> by <m>-x</m> in the equation <m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m>
does not change the equation. That means that a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> is on the
surface if and only if the point <m>(-x,y,z)</m> is on the surface. So the surface
is invariant under reflection in the <m>yz</m>-plane. Similarly, the equation
<m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m> does not change when <m>y</m> is replaced by <m>-y</m> or <m>z</m> is
replaced by <m>-z</m>. Our surface is also invariant reflection in the <m>xz</m>-
and <m>yz</m>-planes. Once we have the part in the first octant, the remaining 
octants can be gotten simply by reflecting about the coordinate planes.
</p>

<p>We can get a more visually meaningful sketch by adding in some vertical
cross-sections. The <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m> cross-sections (also called traces
<mdash/> they are the parts of our surface that are in the <m>yz</m>- and <m>xz</m>-planes,
respectively)
are
<me>
x=0,\ y^2-z^2=1\qquad\text{and}\qquad
y=0,\ 4x^2-z^2=1
</me>
These equations describe hyperbolae
<fn>It's not just a figure of speech!</fn>
. If you don't remember how to sketch them, don't worry. We'll
do it now. We'll first sketch them in 2d. Since

This type of surface is called a hyperboloid of one sheet.
</p>

<p>There are also hyperboloids of two sheets. For example, replacing the <m>+1</m>
on the right hand side of <m>x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m> gives <m>x^2+y^2-z^2=-1</m>, which is
a hyperboloid of two sheets. We'll sketch it quickly in the next example.

Sketch the surface that satisfies <m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=-1</m>.
</p>

<p>\soln As in the last example, we'll start by fixing any number <m>z_0</m> 
and sketching the part of the surface that lies in the horizontal 
plane <m>z=z_0</m>. The intersection of our surface with that horizontal plane is 
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;z=z_0\text{\  \ and\ \ }4x^2+y^2=z_0^2-1

</md>
Think of <m>z_0</m> as a constant. 
<ul>
<li>
If <m>|z_0| \lt 1</m>, then <m>z_0^2-1 \lt 0</m> and there
are no solutions to <m>x^2+y^2=z_0^2-1</m>.
</li>
<li>
If <m>|z_0|=1</m> there is exactly one solution, namely <m>x=y=0</m>.
</li>
<li>
If <m>|z_0| \gt 1</m> then <m>4x^2+y^2=z_0^2-1</m> is an ellipse with 
<m>x</m> semi-axis <m>\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{z_0^2-1}</m> and <m>y</m> semi-axis 
<m>\sqrt{z_0^2-1}</m>. These semi-axes are small when <m>|z_0|</m> is close to
<m>1</m> and grow as <m>|z_0|</m> increases.

<p>\bigskip
<example><title><m>yz=1</m></title>
<p>xml:id="eg_hyperbolic_cylinder"
\medskip
Sketch the surface <m>yz=1</m>. 
</p>

<p>\soln
This surface has a special property that 
makes it relatively easy to sketch. There are no <m>x</m>'s in the equation
<m>yz=1</m>. That means that if some <m>y_0</m> and <m>z_0</m> obey <m>y_0z_0=1</m>,
then the point <m>(x,y_0,z_0)</m> lies on the surface <m>yz=1</m> for all values
of <m>x</m>. As <m>x</m> runs from <m>-\infty</m> to <m>\infty</m>, the point <m>(x,y_0,z_0)</m>
sweeps out a straight line parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis. So the surface
<m>yz=1</m> is a union of lines parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis. It is invariant under
translations parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis. To sketch <m>yz=1</m>, we just need
to sketch its intersection with the <m>yz</m>-plane and then translate the
resulting curve parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis to sweep out the surface.
</p>

<p>We'll start with a sketch of the hyperbola <m>yz=1</m> in two dimensions.
</p>
<sidebyside>

<p>
Next we'll move this 2d sketch into the <m>yz</m>-plane, i.e. the plane <m>x=0</m>,
in 3d, except that we'll only draw in the part in the first octant.

<p>\bigskip
<example><title><m>xyz=1</m></title>
<p>xml:id="eg_xyz"
\medskip
Sketch the surface <m>xyz=4</m>. 
</p>

<p>\soln
We'll sketch this surface using much the same procedure as we used
in Examples <xref ref="eg_hyperboloid"/> and <xref ref="eg_hyperboloid_two"/>.
We'll only sketch the part of the surface in the first octant. The
remaining parts (in the octants with <m>x,y \lt 0</m>, <m>z\ge 0</m>, with
<m>x,z \lt 0</m>, <m>y\ge 0</m> and with <m>y,z \lt 0</m>, <m>x\ge0</m>) are just reflections of
the first octant part.
</p>

<p>As usual, we start by fixing any number <m>z_0</m> 
and sketching the part of the surface that lies in the horizontal 
plane <m>z=z_0</m>. The intersection of our surface with that horizontal plane is 
the hyperbola
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;z=z_0\text{\  \ and\ \ }xy=\frac{1}{z_0}
</mrow>
</md>
Note that <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> as <m>y\rightarrow 0</m> and that 
<m>y\rightarrow\infty</m> as <m>x\rightarrow 0</m>. So the hyperbola 
has both the <m>x</m>-axis and the <m>y</m>-axis as asymptotes, when drawn in the <m>xy</m>-plane. 
The first octant parts of a few of these horizontal cross-sections 
(namely, <m>z_0=4</m>, <m>z_0=2</m> and <m>z_0=\frac{1}{2}</m>)
are drawn in the figure below.
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/seatB.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
Next we add some vertical cross-sections.
We can't use <m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m> because any point on <m>xyz=1</m> 
must have all of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> nonzero. So we use
<me>
x=4,\ yz=1\qquad\text{and}\qquad
y=4,\ xz=1
</me>
instead. They are again hyperbolae.
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/seatC.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
Finally, we clean up and simplify the sketch.

</p>

<p>Often the reason you are interested in a surface in 3d is that it is
the graph <m>z=f(x,y)</m> of a function of two variables <m>f(x,y)</m>. Another good
way to visualize the behaviour of a function <m>f(x,y)</m> is to sketch what
are called its level curves. By definition, a level curve of <m>f(x,y)</m>
is a curve whose equation is <m>f(x,y)=C</m>, for some constant <m>C</m>. It is the
set of points in the <m>xy</m>-plane where <m>f</m> takes the value <m>C</m>. Because
it is a curve in 2d, it is usually easier to sketch than the graph of <m>f</m>.
Here are a couple of examples. 
</p>

<p>\bigskip
<example><title><m>f(x,y) = x^2+4y^2-2x+2</m></title>
<p>
\medskip
Sketch the level curves of <m>f(x,y) = x^2+4y^2-2x+2</m>. 
</p>

<p>\soln  
Fix any real number <m>C</m>. Then, for the specified function <m>f</m>,
the level curve <m>f(x,y)=C</m> is the set of points <m>(x,y)</m> that obey
<md>
<mrow>
x^2+4y^2-2x+2=C
&amp;\iff x^2-2x+1 + 4y^2 +1 =C 
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\iff (x-1)^2 + 4y^2 = C-1
</mrow>
</md>
Now <m>(x-1)^2 + 4y^2</m> is the sum of two squares, and so is always at least zero. 
So if <m>C-1 \lt 0</m>, i.e. if <m>C \lt 1</m>, there is no curve <m>f(x,y)=C</m>. If <m>C-1=0</m>, 
i.e. if <m>C=1</m>, then <m>f(x,y)=C-1=0</m> if and only if both <m>(x-1)^2=0</m> and 
<m>4y^2=0</m> and so the level curve consists of the single point <m>(1,0)</m>. 
If <m>C \gt 1</m>, then <m>f(x,y)=C</m> become <m>(x-1)^2+4y^2=C-1 \gt 0</m> which describes an
ellipse centred on <m>(1,0)</m>. It intersects the <m>x</m>-axis when <m>y=0</m> and 
<me>
(x-1)^2 = C-1 \iff x-1=\pm\sqrt{C-1} \iff x=1\pm \sqrt{C-1} 
</me>
and it intersects the line <m>x=1</m> (i.e. the vertical line through the centre)
when 
<me>
4y^2 = C-1 \iff 2y=\pm\sqrt{C-1} \iff y=\pm\tfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{C-1} 
</me>
So, when <m>C \gt 1</m>, <m>f(x,y)=C</m> is the ellipse centred on <m>(1,0)</m> with 
<m>x</m> semi-axis <m>\sqrt{C-1} </m> and <m>y</m> semi-axis <m>\tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{C-1}</m>.
Here is a sketch of some representative level curves of 
<m>f(x,y) = x^2+4y^2-2x+2</m>.
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/ellipseLevelB.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
It is often easier to develop an understanding of the behaviour of a function
<m>f(x,y)</m> by looking at a sketch of its level curves, than it is by looking
at a sketch of its graph. On the other hand, you can also
use a sketch of the level curves of <m>f(x,y)</m> as the first step in building
a sketch of the graph <m>z=f(x,y)</m>. The next step would be to redraw, 
for each <m>C</m>, the level curve <m>f(x,y)=C</m>, in the plane <m>z=C</m>, as we did in 
Example <xref ref="eg_hyperboloid"/>.
</p>

<p>\bigskip\goodbreak
<example><title><m>e^{x+y+z}=1</m></title>

The function <m>f(x,y)</m> is given implicitly by the equation <m>e^{x+y+z}=1</m>.
Sketch the level curves of <m>f</m>. 
</p>

<p>\soln 
This one is not as nasty as it appears.  
That <q><m>f(x,y)</m> is given implicitly by the equation <m>e^{x+y+z}=1</m></q>
means that, for each <m>x,y</m>,  the solution <m>z</m> of <m>e^{x+y+z}=1</m> is
<m>f(x,y)</m>. So, for the specified function <m>f</m> and any fixed real number <m>C</m>,
the level curve <m>f(x,y)=C</m> is the set of points <m>(x,y)</m> that obey
<md>
<mrow>
e^{x+y+C}=1
&amp;\iff x+y+C = 0\qquad\text{(by taking the logarithm of both sides)} 
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\iff x+y = -C
</mrow>
</md>
This is of course a straight line. It intersects the <m>x</m>-axis when <m>y=0</m> 
and <m>x=-C</m> and it intersects the <m>y</m>-axis when <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=-C</m>.
Here is a sketch of some level curves.

</sidebyside>
</example>
</p>

<p>We have just seen that sketching the level curves of a function <m>f(x,y)</m>
can help us understand the behaviour of <m>f</m>. We can generalise this
to functions <m>F(x,y,z)</m> of three variables. A level surface of <m>F(x,y,z)</m>
is a surface whose equation is of the form <m>F(x,y,z)=C</m> for some 
constant <m>C</m>. It is the set of points <m>(x,y,z)</m> at which <m>F</m> takes 
the value <m>C</m>.

So for any fixed <m>y_0</m>, the intersection of the our surface

<p>\section{Cylinders}xml:id="sec_cylinders"
</p>

<p>There some classes of relatively simple, but commonly occurring, 
surfaces that are given their own names. One such class is cylindrical surfaces.
You are probably used to thinking of a cylinder as being something that looks 
like <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>. 
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/cylinderA.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
In Mathematics the word <q>cylinder</q> is given a more general meaning.
</p>

<p><definition><title>Cylinder</title>
<statement><p>xml:id="def_cylinder"
A <em>cylinder</em> is a surface that consists of all points that are 
on all lines that are
<ul>
<li>sep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
</li>
<li>   parallel to a given line and
</li>
<li>   pass through a given fixed plane curve (in a plane not parallel
to the given line).
</li>
</ul>
</p></statement>
</definition>
</p>

<p><example>
<p>xml:id="eg_cylinders"
Here are sketches of three cylinders.
The familiar cylinder on the left below
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/cylinderR.pdf"/>\qquad
   <image source="problems/figs/cylinderO.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
is called a right circular cylinder, because the given fixed plane curve
(<m>x^2+y^2=1</m>, <m>z=0</m>)
is a circle and the given line (the <m>z</m>-axis) is perpendicular 
(i.e. at right angles) to the fixed plane curve.
</p>

<p>The cylinder on the left above can be thought of as a vertical stack of 
circles. The cylinder on the right above can also be thought of as a stack 
of circles, but the centre of the circle at height <m>z</m> has been shifted
rightward to <m>(0,z,z)</m>. For that cylinder, the given fixed plane curve 
is once again the circle <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>, <m>z=0</m>, but the given line is <m>y=z</m>, <m>x=0</m>.
</p>

<p>We have already seen the the third cylinder 
</p>
<sidebyside>
<image source="problems/figs/hyperbolicCylinderD.pdf"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
in Example <xref ref="eg_hyperbolic_cylinder"/>. It is called a hyperbolic cylinder.
In this example, the given fixed plane curve is the hyperbola <m>yz=1</m>, <m>x=0</m>
and the given line is the <m>x</m>-axis.
</p></example>
</p>

<p>\section{Quadric Surfaces}xml:id="sec_quadrics"
</p>

<p>Another named class of relatively simple, but commonly occurring, 
surfaces is the quadric surfaces.
</p>

<p><definition><title>Quadrics</title>
<statement><p>xml:id="def_quadric"
A <em>quadric</em> surface is surface that consists of all points that
obey <m>Q(x,y,z)=0</m>, with <m>Q</m> being a polynomial of degree two
<fn>Technically, we should also require that the polynomial
can't be factored into the product of two polynomials of degree one.</fn>
. 
</p></statement>
</definition>
For <m>Q(x,y,z)</m> to be a polynomial of degree two, it must be of the form
<md>
<mrow>
Q(x,y,z) = Ax^2 +By^2 +Cz^2 +Dxy +Eyz +Fxz +Gx +Hy +Iz +J
</mrow>
</md>
for some constants <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>\cdots</m>, <m>J</m>. Each constant <m>z</m> cross section
of a quadric surface has an equation of the form
<md>
<mrow>
Ax^2 + Dxy +By^2 +gx +hy +j =0,\quad z=z_0
</mrow>
</md>
If <m>A=B=D=0</m> but <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are not both zero, this is a straight line.
If <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>D</m> are not all zero, then by rotating and translating 
our coordinate system the equation of the cross section can be brought
into one of the forms
<fn>This statement can be justified using a 
linear algebra eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis. It is 
beyond what we can cover here, but is not too difficult for a standard 
linear algebra course.</fn>
</p>

<p><ul>
<li>
<m>\al x^2 + \be y^2 =\ga</m> with <m>\al,\be \gt 0</m>, which, if <m>\ga \gt 0</m>, is an ellipse
(or a circle),
</li>
<li>
<m>\al x^2 - \be y^2 =\ga</m> with <m>\al,\be \gt 0</m>, which, if <m>\ga\ne0</m>, is a hyperbola,
and if <m>\ga=0</m> is two lines,
</li>
<li> 
<m>x^2 = \delta y</m>, which, if <m>\delta\ne 0</m> is a parabola, and if <m>\delta=0</m> is a straight line.
</li>
</ul>
There are similar statements for the constant <m>x</m> cross sections and the
constant <m>y</m> cross sections. Hence quadratic surfaces are built by stacking
these three types of curves.
</p>

<p>We have already seen a number of quadric surfaces in the last couple of 
sections.

<title>Triple Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates</title>
<introduction>

<p>Many problems possess natural symmetries. We can make our work easier
by using coordinate systems, like  polar coordinates, that are
tailored to those symmetries. In this section we will look at two
more such coordinate systems <mdash/> cylindrical and spherical coordinates.

  <title>Cylindrical Coordinates</title>


<p>In the event that we wish to compute, for example, the mass
of an object that is invariant under rotations about the
<m>z</m>-axis
<fn>like a pipe or a can of tuna fish</fn>
,
it is advantageous to use a natural generalization of polar coordinates
to three dimensions. The coordinate system is called <em>cylindrical
coordinates</em>.

  <title>The Volume Element in Cylindrical Coordinates</title>


<p> Before we can start integrating using these coordinates
we need to determine the volume element. Recall that before integrating
in polar coordinates, we had to establish that
<m>\dee{A}=r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}</m>. In the arguments that follow we establish
that <m>\dee{V} =r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}\,\dee{z}</m>.
</p>

<p>If we cut up a solid by
<ul>
<li><p>
first slicing it into horizontal plates of thickness <m>\dee{z}</m>
by using planes of constant <m>z</m>,
</p>

<sidebyside>
<image source="figs/sphereCyl1"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
<li><p>
and then subdividing the plates into wedges using surfaces of  constant <m>\theta</m>,
say with the difference between successive <m>\theta</m>'s being <m>\dee{\theta}</m>,
</p>

<sidebyside>
<image source="figs/sphereCyl2"/>

</li>
<li><p>
and then subdividing the wedges into approximate cubes using surfaces
of  constant <m>r</m>, say with the difference between successive <m>r</m>'s
being <m>\dee{r}</m>,
</p>

<sidebyside>
<image source="figs/sphereCyl3"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
</ul>
we end up with approximate cubes that look like
</p>

<sidebyside>
<image source="figs/cylCube"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
When we introduced slices using surfaces of constant <m>r</m>,
the difference between the successive <m>r</m>'s was <m>\dee{r}</m>, so the indicated
edge of the cube has length <m>\dee{r}</m>.
</li>
<li>
When we introduced slices using surfaces of constant <m>z</m>,
the difference between the successive <m>z</m>'s was <m>\dee{z}</m>, so the vertical
edges of the cube have length <m>\dee{z}</m>.
</li>
<li>
When we introduced slices using surfaces of constant <m>\theta</m>,
the difference between the successive <m>\theta</m>'s was <m>\dee{\theta}</m>, so
the remaining edges of the cube are circular arcs of radius
essentially
<fn>The inner edge has radius <m>r</m>,
but the outer edge has radius <m>r+\dee{r}
</m>. However the error that this generates goes to zero in the limit <m>\dee{r}</m>, <m>\dee{\theta}</m>, <m>\dee{z}</m> <m>\rightarrow 0</m>.</fn>

so have length <m>r\,\dee{\theta}</m>. See the derivation of equation

So the volume of the approximate cube in cylindrical coordinates is

  <title>Sample Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates</title>


<p>Now we can use <xref ref="eq_dV_cylindrical"/> to handle a variant of
Example <xref ref="eg_sphere_mass_A"/>
in which the density is invariant under rotations around the <m>z</m> axis.
Cylindrical coordinates are tuned to provide easier integrals to
evaluate when the integrand is invariant under rotations about the <m>z</m>-axis,
or when the domain of integration is cylindrical.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_sphere_mass_B">
<statement>
<p>
Find the mass inside the sphere <m>x^2+y^2+z^2=1</m> if the density
is <m>\rho(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2</m> (which is the square of the
distance from the <m>z</m>-axis).
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
Before we get started, note that both the integrand, <m>x^2+y^2</m>,
and the domain of integration, <m>x^2+y^2+z^2\le 1</m>, are invariant under rotations about the <m>z</m>-axis. That makes this
integral a good candidate for cylindrical coordinates.
</p>

<p>Again, by symmetry the total mass of the sphere will be eight times
the mass in the first octant. We shall cut the first octant part
of the sphere into tiny pieces using  cylindrical coordinates. That is,
we shall cut it up using planes of constant <m>z</m>, planes of constant <m>\theta</m>,
and surfaces of constant <m>r</m>.
<ul>
<li><p>
First slice the (the first octant part of the) sphere into horizontal
plates by inserting many planes of
constant <m>z</m>, with the various values of <m>z</m> differing by <m>\dee{z}</m>.
The figure on the left below shows the part of one plate in the first octant
outlined in red. Each plate
<ul>
<li>
has thickness <m>\dee{z}</m>,
</li>
<li>
has <m>z</m> essentially constant on the plate, and
</li>
<li>
has <m>(x,y)</m> running over <m>x\ge 0</m>, <m>y\ge 0</m>, <m>x^2+y^2\le 1-z^2</m>.
In cylindrical coordinates, <m>r</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>\sqrt{1-z^2}</m>
and <m>\theta</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
</li>
<li>
The bottom plate has, essentially, <m>z=0</m> and the top plate has, essentially,
<m>z=1</m>. See the figure on the right below.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<sidebyside>
<image source="figs/sphereCyl1a"/>
<image source="figs/sphereCyl1b"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
So far, this looks just like what we did in Example <xref ref="eg_sphere_mass_A"/>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Concentrate on any one plate. Subdivide it into wedges
by inserting many planes of constant <m>\theta</m>, with the various
values of <m>\theta</m> differing by <m>\dee{\theta}</m>. The figure on the
left below shows one such wedge outlined in blue. Each wedge
<ul>
<li>
has <m>z</m>  and <m>\theta</m> essentially constant on the wedge, and
</li>
<li>
has <m>r</m> running over <m>0\le r\le \sqrt{1-z^2}</m>.
</li>
<li> The leftmost wedge has, essentially, <m>\theta=0</m> and the rightmost
wedge has, essentially, <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.  See the figure
on the right below.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<sidebyside>
<image source="figs/sphereCyl2a"/>

</sidebyside>
</li>
<li><p>
Concentrate on any one wedge. Subdivide it into tiny approximate cubes
by inserting many surfaces of constant <m>r</m>, with the various values of <m>r</m> differing by <m>\dee{r}</m>. The figure on the left below shows the top of one
approximate cube in black. Each cube
<ul>
<li>
has volume <m>r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}\,\dee{z}</m>, by <xref ref="eq_dV_cylindrical"/>
and
</li>
<li>
has <m>r</m>, <m>\theta</m> and <m>z</m> all essentially constant on the cube.
</li>
<li> The first cube has, essentially, <m>r=0</m> and the last cube has,
essentially, <m>r=\sqrt{1-z^2}</m>.  See the figure on the right below.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<sidebyside>
<image source="figs/sphereCyl3a"/>
<image source="figs/sphereCyl3b"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Now we can build up the mass.
<ul>
<li><p>
Concentrate on one approximate cube. Let's say that it contains the point
with cylindrical coordinates <m>r</m>, <m>\theta</m> and <m>z</m>.
<ul>
<li>
The cube has volume essentially <m>\dee{V}=r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}\,\dee{z}</m>
and
</li>
<li>
essentially has density <m>\rho(x,y,z)=\rho(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,z) = r^2</m>
and so
</li>
<li>
essentially has mass <m>r^3\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}\,\dee{z}</m>.
(See how nice the right coordinate system can be!)
</li>
</ul></p>
</li>
<li>
To get the mass any one wedge, say the wedge whose <m>\theta</m> coordinate runs
from <m>\theta</m> to <m>\theta+\dee{\theta}</m>, we just add up the masses of
the approximate cubes in that wedge, by integrating <m>r</m> from its smallest
value on the wedge, namely <m>0</m>, to its largest value on the wedge, namely
<m>\sqrt{1-z^2}</m>. The mass of the wedge is thus
<md>
<mrow>
\dee{\theta}\,\dee{z} \int_0^{\sqrt{1-z^2}}  \dee{r}\,r^3
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li>
To get the mass of any one plate, say the plate whose <m>z</m> coordinate runs
from <m>z</m> to <m>z+\dee{z}</m>, we just add up the masses of the wedges
in that plate, by integrating <m>\theta</m> from its smallest value on
the wedge, namely <m>0</m>, to its largest value on the wedge, namely
<m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>. The mass of the plate is thus
<md>
<mrow>
\dee{z}\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\theta}\int_0^{\sqrt{1-z^2}}  \dee{r}\,r^3
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li>
To get the mass of the part of the sphere in the first octant, we just
add up the masses of the plates that it contains, by integrating <m>z</m> from its smallest value in the octant, namely <m>0</m>, to its largest value on the sphere,
namely  <m>1</m>. The mass in the first octant is thus
<md>
<mrow>
\int_0^1\dee{z}\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\theta}\int_0^{\sqrt{1-z^2}}  \dee{r}\,r^3
&amp;= \frac{1}{4}\int_0^1\dee{z}\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\theta}\ {(1-z^2)}^2
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;= \frac{\pi}{8}\int_0^1\dee{z}\ {(1-z^2)}^2
 =\frac{\pi}{8}\int_0^1\dee{z}\ (1-2z^2+z^4)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;= \frac{\pi}{8}\overbrace{\left[1-\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{5}\right]}^{8/15}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\frac{1}{15}\pi
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li>
So the mass of the total (eight octant) sphere is <m>8\times\frac{1}{15}\pi=\frac{8}{15}\pi</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Just by way of comparison, here is the integral in Cartesian
coordinates that gives the mass in the first octant. (We found the limits
of integration in Example <xref ref="eg_sphere_mass_A"/>.)

<p>The Definition <xref ref="def_moment_of_inertia"/> of the moment of inertia

the same analysis extends naturally to the definition

Our solid has constant density and mass <m>M</m>, so

The formula
<me>
\text{Volume}(\cV)= \frac{1}{3} \pi a^2 h
</me>
for the volume of a cone was derived in Example \eref{CLP101}{eg:VOLa}
of the CLP-2 text and in Appendix B.5.2 of the CLP-1 text.
However because of the similarity between
the integral
<m>\text{Volume}(\cV)=\tripInt_\cV \dee{x}\,\dee{y}\,\dee{z}</m>
and the integral
<m>\tripInt_\cV (x^2+z^2)\ \dee{x}\,\dee{y}\,\dee{z}</m>, that we need for our
computation of <m>I_\cA</m>, it is easy to rederive the volume formula and we
shall do so.
</p>

<p>We'll evaluate both of the integrals above using cylindrical coordinates.
<ul>
<li><p>
Start by slicing the cone into horizontal plates by inserting many planes of
constant <m>z</m>, with the various values of <m>z</m> differing by <m>\dee{z}</m>.

<sidebyside>
<image source="figs/coneP"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
Each plate
<ul>
<li>
is a circular disk of thickness <m>\dee{z}</m>.
</li>
<li><p>
By similar triangles, as in the figure on the right below,
the disk at height <m>z</m> has radius <m>R</m> obeying
<me>
\frac{R}{z} = \frac{a}{h}
\implies R =\frac{a}{h}z
</me>
</p>

<sidebyside>
<image source="figs/coneX"/>
<image source="figs/coneT"/>

</li>
<li>
So the disk at height <m>z</m> has the
cylindrical coordinates <m>r</m> running from <m>0</m> to <m>\frac{a}{h}z</m>
and <m>\theta</m> running from <m>0</m> to <m>2\pi</m>.

The bottom plate has, essentially, <m>z=0</m> and the top plate has, essentially,

Now concentrate on any one plate. Subdivide it into wedges

The first wedge has, essentially <m>\theta=0</m> and the last wedge has,

</li>
<li><p>
Concentrate on any one wedge. Subdivide it into tiny approximate
cubes
<fn>Again they are wonky cubes, but we can bound the error
and show that it goes to zero in the limit <m>\dee{r}

by inserting many surfaces of constant <m>r</m>, with the various values of <m>r</m> differing by <m>\dee{r}</m>.  Each cube

has volume <m>r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}\,\dee{z}</m>, by <xref ref="eq_dV_cylindrical"/>.

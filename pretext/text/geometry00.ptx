<title>Vectors and Geometry in Two and Three Dimensions</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
  Before we get started doing calculus in two and three dimensions we need to brush up on some basic geometry, that we will use a lot.
  We are already familiar with the Cartesian plane<fn>
  Ren√© Descartes (1596<ndash/>1650) was a French scientist and philosopher, who lived in the Dutch Republic for roughly twenty years after serving in the (mercenary) Dutch States Army.
  He is viewed as the father of analytic geometry, which uses numbers
  to study geometry.
</fn>,
but we'll start from the beginning.

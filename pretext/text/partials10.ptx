<title>Lagrange Multipliers</title>
<introduction>

<p>In the last section we had to solve a number of problems
of the form <q>What is the maximum value of the function <m>f</m>
on the curve <m>C</m>?</q> In those examples, the curve <m>C</m> was simple
enough that we could reduce the problem to finding the maximum
of a function of one variable. For more complicated problems
this reduction might not be possible. In this section, we introduce
another method for solving such problems. First some nomenclature.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def_constrained_optimization">
<statement><p>
A problem of the form
<ul>
<li> <q>Find the maximum and minimum values of the function
<m>f(x,y)</m> for <m>(x,y)</m> on the curve <m>g(x,y)=0</m>.</q>
</li>
</ul>
is one type of <em>constrained optimization</em> problem. The function
being maximized or minimized, <m>f(x,y)</m>, is called the <em>objective
function</em>. The function, <m>g(x,y)</m>, whose zero set is the curve of interest,
is called the <em>constraint function</em>.
</p></statement>
</definition>


<p>Such problems are quite common. As we said above, we have already
encountered them in the last section on absolute maxima and minima,
when we were looking for the extreme values of a function on the
boundary of a region. In economics
<q>utility functions</q> are used to model the relative <q>usefulness</q>
or <q>desirability</q> or <q>preference</q>
of various economic choices. For example, a utility function <m>U(w,\ka)</m>
might specify the relative level of satisfaction a consumer would get
from purchasing a quantity <m>w</m> of wine and <m>\ka</m> of coffee. If the consumer
wants to spend $100 and wine costs $20 per unit
and coffee costs $5 per unit, then the consumer would like to maximize
<m>U(w,\ka)</m> subject to the constraint that <m>20w+5\ka=100</m>.
</p>

<p>To this point we have always solved such constrained optimization
problems either by
<ul>
<li> solving <m>g(x,y)=0</m> for <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> (or for
<m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>) or by
</li>
<li> parametrizing the curve <m>g(x,y)=0</m>. This means writing all points
of the curve in the form <m>\big(x(t), y(t)\big)</m> for some functions <m>x(t)</m>
and <m>y(t)</m>. For example we used <m>x(t)=\cos t</m>, <m>y(t)=\sin t</m> as
a parametrization of the circle <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> in Example <xref ref="eg_MXMNabsA"/>.
</li>
</ul>
However quite often the function <m>g(x,y)</m> is so complicated that
one cannot explicitly solve <m>g(x,y)=0</m> for <m>y</m> as a function  of <m>x</m> or
for <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m> and one also cannot explicitly
parametrize <m>g(x,y)=0</m>. Or sometimes you can, for example, solve <m>g(x,y)=0</m>
for <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>, but the resulting solution is so
complicated that it is really hard, or even virtually impossible, to work
with. Direct attacks become even harder in higher dimensions when, for example,
we wish to optimize a function <m>f(x,y,z)</m> subject to a constraint
<m>g(x,y,z)=0</m>.
</p>

<p>There is another procedure called the method of
<q>Lagrange  multipliers</q><fn>Joseph-Louis Lagrange was actually born
Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia in Turin, Italy in 1736. He moved to Berlin
in 1766 and then to Paris in 1786. He eventually acquired French citizenship
and then the French claimed he was a French mathematician, while the
Italians continued to claim that he was an Italian mathematician.</fn>
that comes to our rescue in these scenarios. Here is the three dimensional
version of the method. There are obvious analogs in other dimensions.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_Lagrange"><title>Lagrange Multipliers</title>
<statement><p>
Let <m>f(x,y,z)</m> and <m>g(x,y,z)</m>  have continuous first partial derivatives in a
region of <m>\bbbr^3</m> that contains the surface <m>S</m> given by the equation
<m>g(x,y,z)=0</m>. Further assume that <m>\vnabla g(x,y,z)\ne\vZero</m> on <m>S</m>.
</p>

<p>If <m>f</m>, restricted
to the surface <m>S</m>, has a local extreme value at the point <m>(a,b,c)</m> on <m>S</m>,
then there is a real number <m>\la</m> such that
<md>
<mrow>
\vnabla f(a,b,c) &amp;= \la\vnabla g(a,b,c)
</mrow>
<intertext>that is</intertext><mrow>
f_x(a,b,c) &amp;= \la\, g_x(a,b,c)
</mrow><mrow>
f_y(a,b,c) &amp;= \la\, g_y(a,b,c)
</mrow><mrow>
f_z(a,b,c) &amp;= \la\, g_z(a,b,c)
</mrow>
</md>
The number <m>\la</m> is called a <em>Lagrange multiplier</em>.
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
<p>
Suppose that <m>(a,b,c)</m> is a
point of <m>S</m> and that <m>f(x,y,z)\ge f(a,b,c)</m> for all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> on <m>S</m>
that are close to <m>(a,b,c)</m>. That is <m>(a,b,c)</m> is a local minimum for <m>f</m>
on <m>S</m>. Of course the argument for a local maximum is virtually identical.
</p>

<p>Imagine that we go for a walk on <m>S</m>, with the time <m>t</m> running, say,
from <m>t=-1</m> to <m>t=+1</m> and that at time <m>t=0</m> we happen to be exactly
at <m>(a,b,c)</m>. Let's say that our position is <m>\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)</m>
at time <m>t</m>.
</p>

<p>Write
<me>
F(t) = f\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)
</me>
So <m>F(t)</m> is the value of <m>f</m> that we see on our walk at time <m>t</m>. Then
for all <m>t</m> close to <m>0</m>, <m>\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)</m> is close
to <m>\big(x(0),y(0),z(0)\big)=(a,b,c)</m> so that
<me>
F(0) = f\big(x(0),y(0),z(0)\big)
     = f(a,b,c)
     \le f\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)
     =F(t)
</me>
for all <m>t</m> close to zero. So <m>F(t)</m> has a local minimum at <m>t=0</m>
and consequently <m>F'(0)=0</m>.
</p>

<p>By the chain rule, Theorem <xref ref="thm_chainRule"/>,
<md>
<mrow>
F'(0) &amp;= \diff{}{t}f\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)\Big|_{t=0}
</mrow><mrow>
      &amp;=f_x\big(a,b,c\big) x'(0)+f_y\big(a,b,c\big) y'(0)
               +f_z\big(a,b,c\big) z'(0)
       =0
\tag{$*$}</mrow>
</md>
We may rewrite this as a dot product:
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;0=F'(0)=\vnabla f(a,b,c)\cdot\llt x'(0)\,,\,y'(0)\,,\,z'(0)\rgt
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\implies \vnabla f(a,b,c) \perp \llt x'(0)\,,\,y'(0)\,,\,z'(0)\rgt
</mrow>
</md>
This is true for all paths on <m>S</m> that pass through <m>(a,b,c)</m> at time <m>0</m>.
In particular it is true for all vectors <m>\llt x'(0)\,,\,y'(0)\,,\,z'(0)\rgt</m>
that are tangent to <m>S</m> at <m>(a,b,c)</m>. So <m>\vnabla f(a,b,c)</m> is perpendicular
to <m>S</m> at <m>(a,b,c)</m>.
</p>

<p>But we already know, by Theorem <xref ref="thm_tan_plane_G"/>.a,
that <m>\vnabla g(a,b,c)</m> is also perpendicular to <m>S</m> at <m>(a,b,c)</m>.
So <m>\vnabla f(a,b,c)</m> and <m>\vnabla g(a,b,c)</m> have to be parallel vectors.
That is,
<me>
\vnabla f(a,b,c) = \la \vnabla g(a,b,c)
</me>
for some number <m>\la</m>. That's the Lagrange multiplier rule of our
theorem.
</p></proof>

<p>So to find the maximum and minimum values of <m>f(x,y,z)</m> on a surface
<m>g(x,y,z)=0</m>, assuming that both the objective function <m>f(x,y,z)</m>
and constraint function <m>g(x,y,z)</m> have continuous first partial
derivatives and that <m>\vnabla g(x,y,z)\ne\vZero</m>, you
<ol>
<li> build up a list of candidate points <m>(x,y,z)</m> by finding all
solutions to the equations
<md>
<mrow>
f_x(x,y,z) &amp;= \la\, g_x(x,y,z)
</mrow><mrow>
f_y(x,y,z) &amp;= \la\, g_y(x,y,z)
</mrow><mrow>
f_z(x,y,z) &amp;= \la\, g_z(x,y,z)
</mrow><mrow>
g(x,y,z)&amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
Note that there are four equations and four unknowns, namely <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>
and <m>\lambda</m>.
</li>
<li> Then you evaluate <m>f(x,y,z)</m> at each <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the list
of candidates.
   The biggest of these candidate values is the absolute maximum
   and the smallest of these candidate values is the absolute minimum.
</li>
</ol>
Another way to write the system of equations in the first step is
<me>
L_x(a,b,c,\la) = L_y(a,b,c,\la) = L_z(a,b,c,\la) = L_\la(a,b,c,\la) = 0
</me>
where <m>L(x,y,z,\la)</m> is the auxiliary function<fn>We call <m>L</m> an auxiliary function because, while we use it to help solve the problem,
it doesn't actually appear in either the statement of the question or in
the answer itself</fn> <fn>Some people
use <m>L(x,y,z,\la)=f(x,y,z)+\la\, g(x,y,z)</m> instead. This amounts to renaming
<m>\la</m> to <m>-\la</m>. While we care that <m>\la</m> has a value, we don't care what it
is.</fn>.
</p>

<p><me>
L(x,y,z,\la)=f(x,y,z)-\la\, g(x,y,z)
</me>
</p>

<p>Now for a bunch of examples.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_LagrangeA">
<statement>
<p>
Find the maximum and minimum of the function <m>x^2-10x-y^2</m> on the
ellipse whose equation is <m>x^2+4y^2= 16</m>.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p> For this problem the objective function is <m>f(x,y) = x^2-10x-y^2</m>
and the constraint function is <m>g(x,y)=x^2+4y^2-16</m>.
To apply the method of Lagrange multipliers we need <m>\vnabla f</m>
and <m>\vnabla g</m>. So we start by computing the first order derivatives
of these functions.
<me>
f_x=2x-10\qquad
f_y=-2y\qquad
g_x=2x\qquad
g_y=8y
</me>
So, according to the method of Lagrange multipliers, we need to find all solutions to
<md>
<mrow>
2x-10&amp;=\la (2x)
</mrow><mrow>
-2y&amp;=\la (8y)
</mrow><mrow>
x^2+4y^2-16&amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
Rearranging these equations gives
<md>
<mrow>
     (\la-1)x&amp;=-5 \tag{E1}
</mrow><mrow>
     (4\la+1)y&amp;=0 \tag{E2}
</mrow><mrow>
   x^2+4y^2-16&amp;=0   \tag{E3}
</mrow>
</md>
From (E2), we see that we must have either
<m>\la=-\frac{1}{4}</m> or <m>y=0</m>.
<ul>
<li> If <m>\la=-\frac{1}{4}</m>, (E1) gives
<m>-\frac{5}{4}x=-5</m>, i.e. <m>x=4</m>, and then
(E3) gives <m>y=0</m>.
</li>
<li> If <m>y=0</m>, then (E3) gives <m>x=\pm 4</m> (and while we could easily
use (E1) to solve for <m>\la</m>, we don't actually need <m>\la</m>).
</li>
</ul>
So the method of Lagrange multipliers, Theorem <xref ref="thm_Lagrange"/>
(actually the dimension two version of Theorem <xref ref="thm_Lagrange"/>), gives
that the only possible locations of the maximum and minimum of the function
<m>f</m> are <m>(4,0)</m> and <m>(-4,0)</m>. To complete the problem, we only have to
compute <m>f</m> at those points.

Hence the maximum value of <m>x^2-10x-y^2</m> on the ellipse is <m>56</m>
and the minimum value is <m>-24</m>.

</solution>
</example>

<p>In the previous example, the objective function and the constraint were
specified explicitly. That will not always be the case. In the next example,
we have to do a little geometry to extract them.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_LagrangeB">
  <statement>
<p>
Find the rectangle of largest area (with sides parallel to the coordinates
axes) that can be inscribed in the ellipse <m>x^2+2y^2=1</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
Since this question is so geometric, it is best to start by drawing a
picture.
</p>

<sidebyside width="45%">
<image source="figs/lagrangeB"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>Call the coordinates of the upper right corner of the rectangle
<m>(x,y)</m>, as in the figure above. The four corners of the rectangle are
<m>(\pm x, \pm y)</m> so the rectangle has width <m>2x</m> and height <m>2y</m>
and the objective function is <m>f(x,y) = 4xy</m>.  The constraint function
for this problem is <m>g(x,y)=x^2+2y^2-1</m>. Again, to use Lagrange
multipliers we need the first order partial derivatives.
<me>
f_x=4y\qquad
f_y=4x\qquad
g_x=2x\qquad
g_y=4y
</me>
So, according to the method of Lagrange multipliers, we need to find all solutions to
<md>
<mrow>
4y&amp;=\la (2x) \tag{E1}
</mrow><mrow>
4x&amp;=\la (4y) \tag{E2}
</mrow><mrow>
x^2+2y^2-1&amp;=0  \tag{E3}
</mrow>
</md>
Equation (E1) gives <m>y=\frac{1}{2}\la x</m>.
Substituting this into equation (E2) gives
<md>
<mrow>
4x=2\la^2 x \qquad\text{or}\qquad
         2x\big(2-\la^2\big)=0
</mrow>
</md>
So (E2) is satisfied if either <m>x=0</m> or <m>\la=\sqrt{2}</m> or <m>\la=-\sqrt{2}</m>.
<ul>
<li> If <m>x=0</m>, then (E1) gives <m>y=0</m> too. But
<m>(0,0)</m> violates the constraint equation (E3). Note that, to have a
solution, <em>all</em> of the equations (E1), (E2) and (E3) must be
satisfied.
</li>
<li><p> If <m>\la=\sqrt{2}</m>, then
<ul>
<li>
(E2) gives <m>x=\sqrt{2}y</m> and then
</li>
<li>
(E3) gives <m>2y^2+2y^2=1</m> or <m>y^2=\frac{1}{4}</m> so that
</li>
<li>
<m>y=\pm\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>x=\sqrt{2}y=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</m>.
</li>
</ul></p>
</li>
<li><p> If <m>\la=-\sqrt{2}</m>, then
<ul>
<li>
(E2) gives <m>x=-\sqrt{2}y</m> and then
</li>
<li>
(E3) gives <m>2y^2+2y^2=1</m> or <m>y^2=\frac{1}{4}</m> so that
</li>
<li>
<m>y=\pm\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>x=-\sqrt{2}y=\mp\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</m>.
</li>
</ul></p>
</li>
</ul>
We now have four possible values of <m>(x,y)</m>, namely
<m>\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,,\,\frac{1}{2}\big)</m>,
<m>\big(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,,\,-\frac{1}{2}\big)</m>,
<m>\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,,\,-\frac{1}{2}\big)</m>
and
<m>\big(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,,\,\frac{1}{2}\big)</m>.
They are the four corners of a single rectangle. We said that we wanted
<m>(x,y)</m> to be the upper right corner, i.e. the corner in the first quadrant.
It is <m>\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,,\,\frac{1}{2}\big)</m>.
</p>
</solution>
</example>


<example xml:id="eg_LagrangeC">
<statement>
<p>

</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
 Let <m>(x,y)</m> be a point on <m>3x^2-2xy+3y^2=4</m>. This point is at
the end of a major axis when it maximizes its distance from the centre,
<m>(0,0)</m> of the ellipse. It is at the end of a minor axis when it minimizes
its distance from <m>(0,0)</m>. So we wish to maximize and minimize the
distance <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m> subject to the constraint
<me>
g(x,y)=3x^2-2xy+3y^2-4=0
</me>
Now maximizing/minimizing <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m>
is equivalent<fn>The function <m>S(z)=z^2</m> is a strictly increasing function for <m>z\ge 0</m>. So, for <m>a,b\ge 0</m>, the statement <q><m>a \lt b</m></q> is equivalent to the statement <q><m>S(a) \lt S(b)</m></q>.</fn>
 to maximizing/minimizing
its square <m>\big(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\big)^2=x^2+y^2</m>.
So we are free to choose the objective function
<me>
f(x,y)=x^2+y^2

which we will do, because it makes the derivatives cleaner.
Again, we use Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem, so we start
by finding the partial derivatives.

</mrow>
</md>
To start, let's concentrate on the first two equations. Pretend, for a couple
of minutes, that we already know the value of <m>\la</m> and are trying to find
<m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
<!--
The system of equations
 <m>(1+3\la)x-\la y=0</m>, <m>-\la x+(1+3\la)y=0</m>
has one obvious solution. Namely <m>x=y=0</m>. But this solution is not acceptable
because it does not satisfy the equation of the ellipse. If have already
taken a linear algebra course, you know a system of two linear homogeneous
equations in two unknowns have a nonzero solution if and only if the determinant
of the matrix of coefficients is zero. (You use this when you find eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.) For the equations of interest, this
is
<me>
\det\left[\begin{matrix}
                 1-3\la&amp;\la\\
                \la&amp;1-3\la
          \end{matrix}\right]=(1-3\la)^2-\la^2
=(1-2\la)(1-4\la)=0\implies\la=\half,\frac{1}{4}
</me>
Even if you have not already taken a linear algebra course, you also come to
this conclusion directly when you try to solve the equations.
 -->
Note that <m>\la</m> cannot be zero because if it is, (E1)
forces <m>x=0</m> and (E2) forces <m>y=0</m> and <m>(0,0)</m> is
not on the ellipse, i.e. violates (E3).  So we may divide by <m>\la</m> and (E1)
gives
<me>
y=-\frac{1-3\la}{\la}x
</me>
Subbing this into (E2) gives
<me>
\la x-\frac{(1-3\la)^2}{\la}x=0
</me>
Again, <m>x</m> cannot be zero, since
then <m>y=-\frac{1-3\la}{\la}x</m> would give <m>y=0</m> and <m>(0,0)</m> is still not
on the ellipse.
</p>

<p>So we may divide <m>\la x-\frac{(1-3\la)^2}{\la}x=0</m>
by <m>x</m>, giving
<md>
<mrow>
\la -\frac{(1-3\la)^2}{\la}=0
&amp;\iff (1-3\la)^2-\la^2=0
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\iff 8\la^2-6\la+1 =(2\la-1)(4\la-1)=0
</mrow>
</md>
We now know that <m>\la</m> must be either <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> or <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>.
Subbing these into either (E1) or (E2) gives
<md alignment="alignat">

and <m>(x,y)=\pm\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)</m> from
<m>\la=\frac{1}{4}</m>.
The distance from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>\pm (1,1)</m>, namely <m>\sqrt{2}</m>,
is larger than the distance from <m>(0,0)</m> to
<m>\pm\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big)</m>, namely <m>1</m>.
So the ends of the minor axes are <m>\pm\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big)</m> and the
ends of the major axes are <m>\pm(1,1)</m>. Those ends are sketched in the
figure on the left below. Once we have the ends, it is an easy
matter<fn>if you tilt your head so that the line through
<m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(-1,-1)</m> appears horizontal</fn>
to sketch the ellipse as in the figure on the right below.

</statement>

<solution>
<p>
The constraint <m>4w+2\ka=12</m> is simple enough that we can
easily use it to express <m>\ka</m> in terms of <m>w</m>,
then substitute <m>\ka=6-2w</m> into  <m>U(w,\ka)</m>, and then
maximize
<m>U(w,6-2w) = 6 w^{\frac{2}{3}}(6-2w)^{\frac{1}{3}}</m>

</p>

<p>However, for practice purposes, we'll use Lagrange multipliers
with the objective function
<m>U(w,\ka) =6 w^{\frac{2}{3}}\ka^{\frac{1}{3}}</m>

The first order derivatives of these functions are

The boundary values <m>w=0</m> and <m>\ka=0</m> give utility <m>0</m>, which
is obviously not going to be the maximum utility. So it suffices to
consider only local maxima.
According to the method of Lagrange multipliers, we need to find
all solutions to

<title>(Optional) An Example with Two Lagrange Multipliers</title>


<p>
  In this optional section, we consider an example of a problem of
the form <q>maximize (or minimize)  <m>f(x,y,z)</m> subject to the two
constraints <m>g(x,y,z)=0</m> and <m>h(x,y,z)=0</m></q>. We use the following variant of
Theorem <xref ref="thm_Lagrange"/>.

Assume<fn>This condition says that the normal vectors to <m>g=0</m> and <m>h=0</m>

 that <m>\vnabla g(x,y,z)\times \vnabla h(x,y,z) \ne 0</m>
on <m>C</m>. If <m>f</m>, restricted

then there are real numbers <m>\la</m> and <m>\mu</m> such that

<p>
  for some <m>\la</m> and <m>\mu</m>. So solving this system of five equations in five
unknowns gives all possible candidates for the locations of local maxima
and minima. We'll go through an example shortly.
</p>

<proof><title>Proof of Theorem <xref ref="thm_doubleLagrange"/></title>
<p>
Before we get to the example itself, here is why the above approach
works. Assume that a local minimum occurs at <m>(a,b,c)</m>, which is the
grey point in the schematic figure below. Imagine that you start walking
away from <m>(a,b,c)</m> along the curve <m>g=h=0</m>. Your path is the grey
line in the schematic figure below.
</p>

<sidebyside width="66%">
<image source="figs/dblLagrangeB"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
Call your velocity vector <m>\vv</m>. It is tangent to the curve
<m>g(x,y,z)=h(x,y,z)=0</m>. Because <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>(a,b,c)</m>,
<m>f</m> must be increasing (or constant) as we leave <m>(a,b,c)</m>. So
the directional derivative
<me>
D_{\vv}f(a,b,c)=\vnabla f(a,b,c) \cdot \vv\ge 0
</me>
Now start over. Again walk away from <m>(a,b,c)</m> along the curve <m>g=h=0</m>,
but this time moving in the opposite direction, with velocity vector
<m>-\vv</m>. Again <m>f</m> must be increasing (or constant) as we leave
<m>(a,b,c)</m>, so the directional derivative
<me>
D_{-\vv}f(a,b,c)=\vnabla f(a,b,c) \cdot (-\vv)\ge 0
</me>
As both <m>\vnabla f(a,b,c) \cdot \vv</m> and
<m>-\vnabla f(a,b,c) \cdot \vv</m> are at least zero, we now have
that
<me>
\vnabla f(a,b,c) \cdot \vv=0
\tag{$*$}</me>
for all vectors <m>\vv</m> that are tangent to the curve <m>g=h=0</m>
at <m>(a,b,c)</m>. Let's denote by <m>\cT</m> the set of all vectors <m>\vv</m>
that are tangent to the curve <m>g=h=0</m> at <m>(a,b,c)</m> and let's denote
by <m>\cT^\perp</m> the set of all vectors that are perpendicular to all vectors
in <m>\cT</m>. So <m>(*)</m> says that <m>\vnabla f(a,b,c)</m> must in <m>\cT^\perp</m>.
</p>

<p>We now find all vectors in <m>\cT^\perp</m>. We can easily guess two such vectors.
Since the curve <m>g=h=0</m> lies inside the surface <m>g=0</m> and
<m>\vnabla g(a,b,c)</m>
is normal to <m>g=0</m> at <m>(a,b,c)</m>, we have
<me>
\vnabla g(a,b,c) \cdot \vv=0
\tag{E1}</me>
Similarly, since the the curve <m>g=h=0</m> lies inside the surface <m>h=0</m>
and <m>\vnabla h(a,b,c)</m> is normal to <m>h=0</m> at <m>(a,b,c)</m>, we have
<me>
\vnabla h(a,b,c) \cdot \vv=0
\tag{E2}</me>
Picking any two constants <m>\la</m> and <m>\mu</m>, multiplying (E1)
by <m>\la</m>, multiplying (E2) by <m>\mu</m> and adding gives that
<me>
\big(\la\vnabla g(a,b,c)
     +\mu\vnabla h(a,b,c)\big) \cdot \vv=0
</me>
for all vectors <m>\vv</m>  in <m>\cT</m>. Thus, for all <m>\la</m> and <m>\mu</m>, the
vector <m>\la\vnabla g(a,b,c)+\mu\vnabla h(a,b,c)</m>
is in <m>\cT^\perp</m>.
</p>

<p>Now the vectors in <m>\cT</m> form a line. (They are all tangent to the same
curve at the same point.) So, <m>\cT^\perp</m>, the set of all vectors
perpendicular to <m>\cT</m>,  forms a plane. As <m>\la</m> and <m>\mu</m> run over all
real numbers, the vectors <m>\la\vnabla g(a,b,c)
+\mu\vnabla h(a,b,c)</m>  form a plane. Thus we have found all vector
in <m>\cT^\perp</m> and we conclude that <m>\vnabla f(a,b,c)</m> must be
of the form <m>\la\vnabla g(a,b,c)+\mu\vnabla h(a,b,c)</m>
for some real numbers <m>\la</m> and <m>\mu</m>. The three components of the
equation
<me>
\vnabla f(a,b,c)
=\la\vnabla g(a,b,c)+\mu\vnabla h(a,b,c)
</me>
are exactly the first three equations of <xref ref="eqn_Ll"/>. This completes the
explanation of why Lagrange multipliers work in this setting.

</mrow><mrow>
z^2&amp;=x^2+y^2 \tag{E4}
</mrow><mrow>
x-2z&amp;=3 \tag{E5}
</mrow>
</md>
Since equation (E2) factors so nicely we start there.
It tells us that either <m>y=0</m> or <m>\la=1</m>.
</p>

<p><em>Case <m>\la=1</m>:</em>
When <m>\la=1</m> the remaining equations reduce to

</md>
So
<ul>
<li>
equation (E1) gives <m>\mu=0</m>.
</li>
<li>
Then substituting <m>\mu=0</m> into (E3) gives <m>z=0</m>.
</li>
<li>
Then substituting <m>z=0</m> into (E5) gives <m>x=3</m>.
</li>
<li>
Then substituting <m>z=0</m> and <m>x=3</m> into (E4) gives <m>0=9+y^2</m>,
which is impossible, since <m>9+y^2\ge 9 \gt 0</m> for all <m>y</m>.
</li>
</ul>
So we can't have <m>\la=1</m>.
</p>

<p><em>Case <m>y=0</m>:</em>
When <m>y=0</m> the remaining equations reduce
to

</md>
These don't clean up quite so nicely as in the <m>\la=1</m> case.
But at least equation (E4) tells us that <m>z=\pm x</m>. So we have
to consider those two possibilities.
</p>

<p><em>Subcase <m>y=0</m>, <m>z=x</m>:</em>
When <m>y=0</m> and <m>z=x</m>, the remaining equations reduce to

So equation (E5) now tells us that <m>x=-3</m> so that

(We don't really care what <m>\la</m> and <m>\mu</m> are. But as they

together
<me>
-9+3\la=0 \implies \la=3
</me>
and then, subbing into either equation, <m>\mu=12</m>.)
</p>

<p><em>Subcase <m>y=0</m>, <m>z=-x</m>:</em>
When <m>y=0</m> and <m>z=-x</m>, the

</md>
So equation (E5) now tells us that <m>x=1</m> so that
<m>
(x,y,z)=(1,0,-1)
</m>.
(Again, we don't really care what <m>\la</m> and <m>\mu</m> are. But as they
obey <m>2(1-\la)=\mu</m>, <m>(1+\la)=\mu</m> we have, subtracting the second
equation from the first,
<me>
1-3\la=0
\implies \la=\frac{1}{3}
</me>
and then, subbing into either equation, <m>\mu=\frac{4}{3}</m>.)
</p>

<p><em>Conclusion:</em> We have two candidates for the location
of the max and min, namely <m>(-3,0,-3)</m> and <m>(1,0,-1)</m>. The first is a distance
<m>3\sqrt{2}</m> from the origin, giving the maximum, and the second is a
distance <m>\sqrt{2}</m> from the origin, giving the minimum. In particular,
the distance is <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.

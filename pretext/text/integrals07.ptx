  <title>Spherical Coordinates</title>


<p>In the event that we wish to compute, for example, the mass
of an object that is invariant under rotations about the origin,
it is advantageous to use another generalization of polar coordinates
to three dimensions. The coordinate system is called <em>spherical
coordinates</em>.

  <title>The Details</title>

<p>Here is an explanation of the edge lengths given in the above figure.
Each of the 12 edges of the cube is formed by holding two of the three
coordinates <m>\rho</m>, <m>\theta</m>, <m>\varphi</m> fixed and varying the third.
<ul>
<li><p>
Four of the cube edges are formed by holding <m>\theta</m> and <m>\varphi</m>
fixed and varying <m>\rho</m>. The intersection of a plane of fixed <m>\theta</m>
with a cone of fixed <m>\varphi</m> is a straight line emanating from the origin.
When we introduced slices using spheres of constant <m>\rho</m>,
the difference between the successive <m>\rho</m>'s was <m>\dee{\rho}</m>, so
those edges of the cube each have length <m>\dee{\rho}</m>.

Four of the cube edges are formed by holding <m>\theta</m> and <m>\rho</m>
fixed and varying <m>\varphi</m>. The intersection of a plane of fixed <m>\theta</m>
(which contains the origin) with a sphere of fixed <m>\rho</m>
(which is centred on the origin) is a circle of radius <m>\rho</m> centred
on the origin. It is a line of longitude<fn>The problem of finding
a practical, reliable method for determining the longitude of a ship
at sea was a very big deal for a period of several centuries.
Among the scientists who worked in this were Galileo,
Edmund Halley (of Halley's comet) and Robert Hooke (of Hooke's law).</fn>.

When we introduced searchlights using surfaces of constant <m>\varphi</m>,
the difference between the successive <m>\varphi</m>'s was <m>\dee{\varphi}</m>.
Thus those four edges of the cube are circular arcs of radius

x^2+y^2=\rho^2\sin^2\varphi\qquad

We shall cut the first octant part of the ice cream cone into tiny pieces using
spherical coordinates. That is, we shall cut it up using planes of
constant <m>\theta</m>, cones of constant <m>\varphi</m>, and spheres of constant <m>\rho</m>.
<ul>
<li><p>
First slice the (the first octant part of the) ice cream cone into segments

The figure on the left below shows one segment outlined in red. Each segment

<p>Now we can build up the volume.
<ul>
<li>
Concentrate on one approximate cube. Let's say that it contains the point

The cube has volume essentially <m>\dee{V}
  = \rho^2\sin\varphi\,\dee{\rho}\,\dee{\theta}\,\dee{\varphi}</m>,
by <xref ref="eq_dV_spherical"/>.
</li>
<li>
To get the volume any one searchlight, say the searchlight whose
<m>\varphi</m> coordinate runs from <m>\varphi</m> to <m>\varphi+\dee{\varphi}</m>,
we just add up the volumes of the approximate cubes in that searchlight,
by integrating <m>\rho</m> from its smallest value on the searchlight, namely <m>0</m>,
to its largest value on the searchlight, namely <m>a</m>. The volume of the
searchlight is thus

<mrow>
\dee{\theta}\,\dee{\varphi}\int_0^a\dee{\rho}\  \rho^2\sin\varphi

</md>
</li>
<li>
To get the volume of any one segment, say the segment whose <m>\theta</m>
coordinate runs from <m>\theta</m> to <m>\theta+\dee{\theta}</m>, we just
add up the volumes of the searchlights in that segment, by integrating
<m>\varphi</m> from its smallest value on the segment, namely <m>0</m>, to its
largest value on the segment, namely <m>\beta</m>. The volume of the segment
is thus
<md>

\dee{\theta}\,\int_0^\beta \dee{\varphi}\ \sin\varphi
               \int_0^a\dee{\rho}\  \rho^2
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li>
To get the volume of <m>\cV_1</m>, the part of the ice cream cone in the first octant,
we just add up the volumes of the segments that it contains, by integrating
<m>\theta</m> from its smallest value in the octant, namely <m>0</m>, to its largest value on the octant, namely  <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
</li>
<li>
The volume in the first octant is thus
<md>
<mrow>
\text{Volume}(\cV_1)
&amp;=\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\theta}\,\int_0^\beta \dee{\varphi}\ \sin\varphi
               \int_0^a\dee{\rho}\  \rho^2

&amp;=\frac{a^3}{3}\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\theta}\,

&amp;=\frac{\pi a^3}{6}\big[1-\cos\be\big]

</li>
<li>
So the volume of <m>\cV</m>, the total (four octant) ice cream cone, is
<me>
\text{Volume}(\cV)=4\,\text{Volume}(\cV_1)
=\frac{4\pi a^3}{6}\big[1-\cos\be\big]
</me>
</li>
</ul>
We can express <m>\be</m> (which was not given in the statement of the
original problem) in terms of <m>b</m> (which was in the statement of the
original problem), just by looking at the triangle
</p>

<sidebyside width="20%">
<image source="figs/triangleIceCream"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
The right hand and bottom sides of the triangle have been chosen so that
<m>\tan\be=b</m>, which was the definition of <m>\beta</m>. So
<m>\cos\beta=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+b^2}}</m> and the volume of the ice cream cone is
<me>
\text{Volume}(\cV)
=\frac{2\pi a^3}{3}\left[1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+b^2}}\right]
</me>
Note that, as in Example <xref ref="eg_polar_volume"/>, we can easily apply a
couple of sanity checks to our answer.
<ul>
<li>
If <m>b=0</m>, so that the cone is just <m>x^2+y^2=0</m>, which is the line <m>x=y=0</m>,
the total volume should be zero. Our answer does indeed give
<m>0</m> in this case.
</li>
<li>
In the limit <m>b\rightarrow\infty</m>, the angle <m>\beta\rightarrow\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and the ice cream cone opens up into
a hemisphere of radius <m>a</m>. Our answer does indeed give the volume of
the hemisphere, which is <m>\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{4}{3}\pi a^3</m>.
</li>
</ul>

<example xml:id="eg_cored_apple"><title>Cored Apple</title>

<solution>
<p>
In Example <xref ref="eg_polar_volume"/> we computed the volume removed, basically using cylindrical coordinates. So we could get the answer to this question
just by subtracting the answer of Example <xref ref="eg_polar_volume"/> from
<m>\frac{4}{3}\pi a^3</m>. Instead, we will evaluate the volume remaining
as an exercise in setting up limits of integration when
using spherical coordinates.

<p>As in Example <xref ref="eg_polar_volume"/>, let's use a coordinate system
with the sphere centred on <m>(0,0,0)</m> and with the centre of the drill
hole following the <m>z</m>-axis. Here is a sketch of the apple that remains
in the first octant. It is outlined in red. By symmetry
the total amount of apple remaining will be eight times the amount

</md>
Now <m>\cos\frac{\pi}{2} = \cot\frac{\pi}{2}=0</m> and, if we write
<m>\al=\arcsin\frac{b}{a}</m>,
<md>
<mrow>
\text{Volume}(\cV_1)
&amp;=\frac{\pi}{6}
            \left[a^3 \cos\al - b^3\cot\al\right]
</mrow>
</md>
From the triangle below, we have
<m>\cos\al =\frac{\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}{a} </m> and <m>\cot\al=\frac{\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}{b}</m>.

So<md>
<mrow>
\text{Volume}(\cV_1)
&amp;=\frac{\pi}{6}
            \left[a^2 \sqrt{a^2-b^2} - b^2\sqrt{a^2-b^2}\right]
=\frac{\pi}{6}\big[a^2-b^2\big]^{3/2}

</li>
</ul>
The full (eight octant) volume of the remaining apple is thus
<me>
\text{Volume}(\cV)
=8 \text{Volume}(\cV_1)
=\frac{4}{3}\pi\big[a^2-b^2\big]^{3/2}
</me>
We can, yet again, apply the sanity checks of Example <xref ref="eg_polar_volume"/>
to our answer.
<ul>
<li>
If the radius of the drill bit <m>b=0</m>, no apple is removed at all.
So the total volume remaining should be <m>\frac{4}{3}\pi a^3</m>.
Our answer does indeed give this.
</li>
<li>
If the radius of the drill bit <m>b=a</m>, the radius of the apple,
then the entire apple disappears. So the remaining apple should have
volume <m>0</m>. Again, our answer gives this.
</li>
</ul>
As a final check note that the sum of the answer to
Example <xref ref="eg_polar_volume"/> and the answer to this Example
is <m>\frac{4}{3}\pi a^3</m>, as it should be.

  <title>Curves and their Tangent Vectors</title>
<introduction>

<p>The right hand side of the parametric equation
 <m>(x,y,z)=(1,1,0)+t\llt 1,2,-2\rgt</m> that we just saw in Warning
<xref ref="warn_line_normal"/> is a vector-valued function of the one real
variable <m>t</m>.
We are now going to study more general vector-valued functions of one
real variable. That is, we are going to study functions that assign to
each real number <m>t</m> (typically in some interval) a vector <m>\vr(t)</m>.
For example
<me>
\vr(t) = \big( x(t), y(t), z(t)\big)
</me>
might be the position of a particle at time <m>t</m>. As <m>t</m> varies
<m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out a curve.
</p>
<sidebyside width="38%">
<image source="figs/parCurve"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
While in some applications <m>t</m> will indeed be <q>time</q>, it does not
have to be. It can be simply a parameter that is used to label the
different points on the curve that <m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out. We then say
that <m>\vr(t)</m> provides a parametrization of the curve.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_paramCircle">
<p>
While we will often use <m>t</m> as the parameter in a parametrized curve <m>\vr(t)</m>,
there is no need to call it <m>t</m>. Sometimes it is natural to use a different
name for the parameter. For example, consider the circle <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>.
It is natural to use the angle <m>\theta</m> in the sketch below to label
the point <m>\big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)</m> on the circle.
</p>

<sidebyside width="66%">
<image source="figs/parCircle"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
That is,
<me>
\vr(\theta) = \big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)\qquad
0\le \theta\le 2\pi
</me>
is a parametrization of the circle <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>. Just looking at the figure above, it is clear that, as <m>\theta</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>2\pi</m>, <m>\vr(\theta)</m>
traces out the full circle.
</p>

<p>However beware that just knowing that
<m>\vr(t)</m> lies on a specified curve does not guarantee that, as <m>t</m> varies,
<m>\vr(t)</m> covers the entire curve. For example, as <m>t</m> runs over the whole
real line, <m>\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(t)</m> runs over the interval <m>(-1,1)</m>.
For all <m>t</m>,
<me>
\vr(t) = \big(x(t),y(t)\big)
       = a\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(t)\,,\,
                \sqrt{1-\frac{4}{\pi^2}\arctan^2(t)}\,\right)
</me>
is well-defined and obeys <m>x(t)^2+y(t)^2=a^2</m>. But this <m>\vr(t)</m> does not
cover the entire circle because <m>y(t)</m> is always positive.
</p>

</example>

<p>Curves often arise as the intersection of two surfaces. For example,
the intersection of the sphere <m>x^2+y^2+z^2=1</m>
with the plane <m>y=x</m> is a circle. The part of that circle that is
in the first octant is the red curve in the figure below.
</p>

<sidebyside width="50%">
<image source="figs/spherePlane"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
One way to parametrize such curves is to
choose one of the three coordinates <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> as the parameter,
and solve the two given equations for the remaining two coordinates,
as functions of the parameter. Here are two examples.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_paramIntersectA">
<p>
The set of all <m>(x,y,z)</m> obeying
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
 x&amp;-y           &amp;&amp;=0
</mrow><mrow>
 x^2&amp;+y^2 +z^2 &amp;&amp;=1
</mrow>
</md>
is the circle sketched above. We can choose to use <m>y</m> as the parameter and think of
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
 x&amp;    &amp;&amp;=y
</mrow><mrow>
 x^2&amp;+z^2  &amp;&amp;=1-y^2
</mrow>
</md>
as a system of two equations for the two unknowns <m>x</m> and <m>z</m>,
with <m>y</m> being treated as a given constant, rather than as an unknown.
We can now (trivially) solve the first equation for <m>x</m>, substitute
the result into the second equation, and finally solve for <m>z</m>.
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
x=y,\  x^2+z^2  &amp;&amp;=1-y^2 \quad \implies z^2 = 1-2y^2
</mrow>
</md>
If, for example, we are interested in points <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the curve with
<m>z\ge 0</m>, we have <m>z=\sqrt{1-2y^2} </m> and
<me>
\vr(y) = \left(y\,,\,y\,,\,\sqrt{1-2y^2}\,\right),\qquad
-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\le y \le \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
</me>
is a parametrization for the part of the circle above the <m>xy</m>-plane.
If, on the other hand, we are interested in points <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the curve with
<m>z\le 0</m>, we have <m>z=-\sqrt{1-2y^2} </m> and
<me>
\vr(y) = \left(y\,,\,y\,,\,-\sqrt{1-2y^2}\,\right),\qquad
-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\le y \le \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
</me>
is a parametrization for the part of the circle below the <m>xy</m>-plane.
</p>
</example>


<example xml:id="eg_paramIntersectB">
<p>
The previous example was rigged so that it was easy to solve
for <m>x</m> and <m>z</m> as functions of <m>y</m>. In practice it is not always
easy, or even possible, to do so. A more realistic example is
the set of all <m>(x,y,z)</m> obeying
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
 x^2+\frac{y^2}{2}+\frac{z^2}{3}&amp;=1
</mrow><mrow>
 x^2+2y^2&amp;=z

</md>
which is the blue curve in the figure
</p>

</sidebyside>

<p>
(Don't worry about how we make sketches like this. We'll develop some
surface sketching technique in ยง<xref ref="sec_sketching"/> below.)
Substituting <m>x^2=z-2y^2</m> (from the second equation)
into the first equation gives
<me>
-\frac{3}{2}y^2+z+\frac{z^2}{3}=1
</me>
or, completing the square,
<me>
-\frac{3}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{3}\Big(z+\frac{3}{2}\Big)^2 = \frac{7}{4}
</me>
If, for example, we are interested in points <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the curve with
<m>y\ge 0</m>, this can be solved to give <m>y</m> as a function of <m>z</m>.
<me>
y=\sqrt{\frac{2}{9}\Big(z+\frac{3}{2}\Big)^2-\frac{14}{12}}
</me>
Then <m>x^2=z-2y^2</m> also gives <m>x</m> as a function of <m>z</m>. If <m>x\ge 0</m>,
<md>
<mrow>
x&amp;=\sqrt{z-\frac{4}{9}\Big(z+\frac{3}{2}\Big)^2+\frac{14}{6}}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}-\frac{4}{9}z^2-\frac{1}{3}z}
</mrow>
</md>
The other signs of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be gotten by using the appropriate
square roots. In this example, <m>(x,y,z)</m> is on the curve, i.e. satisfies
the two original equations, if and only if all of <m>(\pm x,\pm y, z)</m> are also
on the curve.

<title>Derivatives and Tangent Vectors</title>


<p>This being a Calculus text, one of our main operations is differentiation.
We are now interested in parametrizations <m>\vr(t)</m>.
It is very easy and natural to extend our definition of derivative to <m>\vr(t)</m>
as follows.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def__curve_deriv">
<statement><p>
The derivative of the vector valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> is defined to be
<me>
\vr'(t) =  \diff{\vr}{t}(t)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}
</me>
</p>
<sidebyside width="35%">
  <image source="figs/parCurveDerivA"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
when the limit exists. In particular, if
<m>\vr(t)=\big(x(t)\,,\,y(t)\,,\,z(t)\big)</m>, then
<me>
\vr'(t)=\big(x'(t)\,,\,y'(t)\,,\,z'(t)\big)
</me>
That is, to differentiate a vector valued function of <m>t</m>, just differentiate
each of its components.
</p></statement>
</definition>


<p>And of course differentiation interacts with arithmetic operations,
like addition, in the obvious way. Only a little more thought is required to
see that differentiation interacts quite nicely with dot and cross
products too.

</theorem>


<p>Let's think about the geometric significance of <m>\vr'(t)</m>.
In particular, let's think about the relationship between <m>\vr'(t)</m>
and distances along the curve.
The derivative <m>\vr'(t)</m> is the limit of   <m>\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}</m> as <m>h\rightarrow 0</m>.
The numerator, <m>\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)</m>, is the vector with head at <m>\vr(t+h)</m>
and tail at <m>\vr(t)</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="50%">
<image source="figs/parCurveDeriv"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
When <m>h</m> is very small this vector
<ul>
<li>
has the essentially the same direction as the tangent vector to the curve at <m>\vr(t)</m> and
</li>
<li>
has length being essentially the length of the part of the curve between
<m>\vr(t)</m> and <m>\vr(t+h)</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Taking the limit as <m>h\rightarrow 0</m> yields that
<ul>
<li>
<m>\vr'(t)</m> is a tangent vector to the curve at <m>\vr(t)</m> that points in
the direction of increasing <m>t</m> and
</li>
<li>
if <m>s(t)</m> is the length of the part of the curve between
<m>\vr(0)</m> and <m>\vr(t)</m>, then  <m>\diff{s}{t}(t)=\big|\diff{\vr}{t}(t)\big|</m>.
</li>
</ul>
This is worth stating formally.

In general it can be quite difficult to compute arc lengths.
So, as an easy warmup example, we will compute the circumference of the circle
<m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>. We'll also find a unit tangent to the circle at any point on
the circle. We'll use the parametrization
<me>
\vr(\theta) = \big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)\qquad
0\le \theta\le 2\pi
</me>
of Example <xref ref="eg_paramCircle"/>. Using Lemma <xref ref="lem_CVtanArclen"/>,
but with the parameter <m>t</m> renamed to <m>\theta</m>

As<fn>You might guess that <m>\Theta</m> is a capital Greek theta. You'd be right.</fn>
 <m>s(\Theta)</m> is the arc length of the part of the circle with
<m>0\le\theta\le\Theta</m>, the circumference of the whole circle is
<me>
s(2\pi) = 2\pi a
</me>
which is reassuring, since this formula has been known<fn>The earliest known written approximations of <m>\pi</m>, in Egypt and Babylon, date
from 1900<ndash/>1600BC. The first recorded algorithm for rigorously evaluating <m>\pi</m>
was developed by Archimedes around 250 BC. The first use of the symbol <m>\pi</m>,
for the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter,
in print was in 1706 by William Jones.</fn>
for thousands of years.

<p>
  The formula <m>s(\Theta)-s(0)=a\Theta</m> also makes sense <mdash/> the part of the
circle with <m>0\le\theta\le\Theta</m> is the fraction <m>\frac{\Theta}{2\pi}</m>
of the whole circle, and so should have length <m>\frac{\Theta}{2\pi}\times
2\pi a</m>. Also note that
<me>
\vr(\theta)\cdot\hat\vT(\theta) = \big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)
\cdot \big(-\sin\theta\,,\cos\theta\big)
=0
</me>
so that the tangent to the circle at any point is perpendicular
to the radius vector of the circle at that point. This is another geometric fact
that has been known<fn>It is Proposition 18 in Book 3 of Euclid's Elements. It was published around 300BC.</fn>
 for thousands of years.

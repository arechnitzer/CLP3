<section xml:id="sec_quadrics"><title>Quadric Surfaces</title>
<p>
  Another named class of relatively simple, but commonly occurring,  surfaces is the quadric surfaces.</p>
<definition xml:id="def_quadric"><title>Quadrics</title>
  <statement><p>
  A <term>quadric</term> surface is surface that consists of all points that
  obey <m>Q(x,y,z)=0</m>, with <m>Q</m> being a polynomial of degree two<fn>Technically, we should also require that the polynomial
  can't be factored into the product of two polynomials of degree one.</fn>.
  </p></statement>
</definition>

<p>
  For <m>Q(x,y,z)</m> to be a polynomial of degree two, it must be of the form
  <md>
  <mrow>
  Q(x,y,z) = Ax^2 +By^2 +Cz^2 +Dxy +Eyz +Fxz +Gx +Hy +Iz +J
  </mrow>
  </md>
  for some constants <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>\cdots</m>, <m>J</m>. Each constant <m>z</m> cross section
  of a quadric surface has an equation of the form
  <md>
  <mrow>
  Ax^2 + Dxy +By^2 +gx +hy +j =0,\quad z=z_0
  </mrow>
  </md>
  If <m>A=B=D=0</m> but <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are not both zero, this is a straight line.
  If <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>D</m> are not all zero, then by rotating and translating
  our coordinate system the equation of the cross section can be brought
  into one of the forms<fn>This statement can be justified using a
  linear algebra eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis. It is
  beyond what we can cover here, but is not too difficult for a standard
  linear algebra course.</fn>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <m>\al x^2 + \be y^2 =\ga</m> with <m>\al,\be \gt 0</m>, which, if <m>\ga \gt 0</m>, is an ellipse
  (or a circle),
  </li>
  <li>
  <m>\al x^2 - \be y^2 =\ga</m> with <m>\al,\be \gt 0</m>, which, if <m>\ga\ne0</m>, is a hyperbola,
  and if <m>\ga=0</m> is two lines,
  </li>
  <li>
  <m>x^2 = \delta y</m>, which, if <m>\delta\ne 0</m> is a parabola, and if <m>\delta=0</m> is a straight line.
  </li>
  </ul>
  There are similar statements for the constant <m>x</m> cross sections and the
  constant <m>y</m> cross sections. Hence quadratic surfaces are built by stacking
  these three types of curves.
  </p>

  <p>We have already seen a number of quadric surfaces in the last couple of
  sections.
  <ul>
  <li>
    <p>
  We saw the quadric surface <m>4x^2+y^2-z^2=1</m> in Example <xref ref="eg_hyperboloid"/>.
  </p>
  <sidebyside width="28%">
  <image source="figs/hyperboloid1.svg"/>
  </sidebyside>
  <p>
  Its constant <m>z</m> cross sections are ellipses and its <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m>
  cross sections are hyperbolae. It is called a hyperboloid of one sheet.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
  We saw the quadric surface <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> in Example <xref ref="eg_cylinders"/>.
  </p>
  <sidebyside  width="25%">
  <image source="figs/cylinder.svg"/>
  </sidebyside>
  <p>
  Its constant <m>z</m> cross sections are circles and its <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m>
  cross sections are straight lines. It is called a right circular cylinder.
</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Appendix <xref ref="app_quadric"/> contains other quadric surfaces.</p>

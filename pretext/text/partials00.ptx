<title>Partial Derivatives</title>
<introduction>
  <p>In this chapter we are going to generalize the definition of
  <q>derivative</q> to functions of more than one variable and then we are
  going to use those derivatives. We will parallel the development
  in Chapters 1 and 2 of the CLP-1 text. We shall
  <ul>
  <li>
  define limits and continuity of functions of more than one variable
  (Definitions <xref ref="def_limit"/> and <xref ref="def_continuity"/>) and then
  </li>
  <li>
  study the properties of limits in more than one dimension
  (Theorem <xref ref="thm_LIMpptiesB"/>) and then
  </li>
  <li>
  define derivatives of functions of more than one variable
  (Definition <xref ref="def_partials"/>).
  </li>
  </ul>
  We are going to be able to speed things up considerably by recycling
  what we have already learned in the CLP-1 text.
  </p>

  <p>We start by generalizing the definition
  of <q>limit</q> to functions of more than one variable.

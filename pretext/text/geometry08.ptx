  <title>Cylinders</title>
<p>There some classes of relatively simple, but commonly occurring,
surfaces that are given their own names. One such class is cylindrical surfaces.
You are probably used to thinking of a cylinder as being something that looks
like <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>.

In Mathematics the word <q>cylinder</q> is given a more general meaning.

<statement><p>
A <term>cylinder</term> is a surface that consists of all points that are
on all lines that are
<ul>
<li>   parallel to a given line and
</li>
<li>   pass through a given fixed plane curve (in a plane not parallel
to the given line).
</li>
</ul>

<example xml:id="eg_cylinders">
  <p>
  Here are sketches of three cylinders. The familiar cylinder on the left below

  is called a right circular cylinder, because the given fixed plane curve
  (<m>x^2+y^2=1</m>, <m>z=0</m>)
  is a circle and the given line (the <m>z</m>-axis) is perpendicular
  (i.e. at right angles) to the fixed plane curve.
  </p>

  <p>The cylinder on the left above can be thought of as a vertical stack of
  circles. The cylinder on the right above can also be thought of as a stack
  of circles, but the centre of the circle at height <m>z</m> has been shifted
  rightward to <m>(0,z,z)</m>. For that cylinder, the given fixed plane curve
  is once again the circle <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>, <m>z=0</m>, but the given line is <m>y=z</m>, <m>x=0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>We have already seen the the third cylinder

  <p>
  in Example <xref ref="eg_hyperbolic_cylinder"/>. It is called a hyperbolic cylinder.
  In this example, the given fixed plane curve is the hyperbola <m>yz=1</m>, <m>x=0</m>
  and the given line is the <m>x</m>-axis.

<title>Tangent Planes and Normal Lines</title>

<introduction>

<p>The tangent line to the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at the point <m>\big(x_0,f(x_0)\big)</m>
is the straight line that fits the curve best<fn>It is possible,
but beyond the scope of this text, to give a precise meaning to
<q>fits best</q>.</fn> at that point.
Finding tangent lines was probably one of the first applications
of derivatives that you saw. See, for example,
Theorem 2.3.2 in the CLP-1 text.
The analog of the tangent line one dimension up is the tangent plane.
The tangent plane to a surface <m>S</m> at a point  <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> is the plane
that fits <m>S</m> best at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>. For example, the tangent plane
to the hemisphere
<me>
S=\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2+(z-1)^2=1,\ 0\le z\le 1}
</me>
at the origin is the <m>xy</m>-plane, <m>z=0</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="40%">
<image source="figs/sphereTanPlane"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>We are now going to determine, as our first application of partial derivatives,
the tangent plane to a general surface <m>S</m> at a general point <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>
lying on the surface.
We will also determine the line which passes through <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>
and whose direction is perpendicular to <m>S</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>. It is called
the normal line to <m>S</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>.
</p>

<p>For example, the following
figure shows the side view of the tangent plane (in black) and normal line
(in blue) to the surface <m>z=x^2+y^2</m> (in red) at the point <m>(0,1,1)</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="66%">
<image source="figs/tanPlaneNormalLine"/>
</sidebyside>

<p> Recall, from <xref ref="eqn_of_plane"/>, that to specify any plane, we need
<ul>
<li>
one point on the plane and
</li>
<li>
a vector perpendicular to the plane, i.e. a normal vector,
</li>
</ul>
and recall, from <xref ref="par_eqn_of_line"/>, that to specify any line, we need
<ul>
<li>
one point on the line and
</li>
<li>
a direction vector for the line.
</li>
</ul>
We already have one point that is on both the tangent plane of interest
and the normal line of interest <mdash/> namely <m>\big(x_0,y_0,z_0\big)</m>.
Furthermore we can use any (nonzero) vector that is perpendicular to <m>S</m>
at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> as both the normal vector to the tangent plane and the
direction vector of the normal line.
</p>

<p>So our main task is to determine a normal vector to the surface <m>S</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>. That's what we do now, first for surfaces of the
form <m>z=f(x,y)</m> and then, more generally, for surfaces of the form
<m>G(x,y,z)=0</m>.
</p>

</introduction>

<subsection>
  <title>Surfaces of the Form <m>z=f(x,y)</m></title>

<p>We construct a vector perpendicular to the surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> at
<m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0,y_0)\big)</m>
by, first, constructing two tangent vectors to the specified surface at
the specified point, and, second, taking the cross product
of those two tangent vectors. Consider the red curve in the figure
below. It is the intersection of our surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m>
</p>

<sidebyside width="66%">
<image source="figs/tanPlaneAA"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
with the plane <m>y=y_0</m>. Here is a side view of the red curve.
</p>

<sidebyside width="75%">
<image source="figs/tanPlaneAAside"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
The vector from the point <m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0,y_0)\big)</m>, on the
red curve, to the point <m>\big(x_0+h\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0+h,y_0)\big)</m>,
also on the red curve, is almost tangent to the red curve, if
<m>h</m> is very small. As <m>h</m> tends to <m>0</m>, that vector, which is
<me>
\llt h\,,\, 0\,,\, f(x_0+h,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)  \rgt
</me>
becomes exactly tangent to the curve. However its length also tends
to <m>0</m>. If we divide by <m>h</m>, and then take the limit <m>h\rightarrow 0</m>,
we get
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{h}
             \llt h\,,\, 0\,,\, f(x_0+h,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)  \rgt
&amp;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}
           \llt 1\,,\, 0\,,\, \frac{f(x_0+h,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h}  \rgt
</mrow>
</md>
Since the limit <m>\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_0+h,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h}</m>
is the definition of the partial derivative <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m>, we get that
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{h}
             \llt h\,,\, 0\,,\, f(x_0+h,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)  \rgt
&amp;=\llt 1\,,\, 0\,,\, f_x(x_0,y_0)\rgt
</mrow>
</md>
is a nonzero vector that is exactly tangent to the red curve and
hence is also tangent to our surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> at the point
<m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0,y_0)\big)</m>.
</p>

<p>For the second tangent vector, we repeat
the process with the blue curve in the figure at the beginning of this
subsection. That blue curve is the intersection of our surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m>
with the plane <m>x=x_0</m>.
Here is a front view of the blue curve.
</p>

<sidebyside width="75%">
<image source="figs/tanPlaneBBside"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
When <m>h</m> is very small, the vector
<me>
\frac{1}{h} \llt 0\,,\, h\,,\, f(x_0,y_0+h)-f(x_0,y_0)  \rgt
</me>
from the point <m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0,y_0)\big)</m>, on the
blue curve, to <m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0+h\,,\,f(x_0,y_0+h)\big)</m>,
also on the blue curve, (and lengthened by a factor <m>\frac{1}{h}</m>) is
almost tangent to the blue curve. Taking the limit <m>h\rightarrow0</m> gives the tangent vector
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{h}
         \llt 0\,,\, h\,,\, f(x_0,y_0+h)-f(x_0,y_0)  \rgt
&amp;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}
          \llt 0\,,\, 1\,,\, \frac{f(x_0,y_0+h)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h}  \rgt
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\llt 0\,,\, 1\,,\, f_y(x_0,y_0)\rgt
</mrow>
</md>
to the blue curve at the point  <m>\big(a\,,\,b\,,\,f(a,b)\big)</m>.
</p>

<p>Now that we have two vectors in the tangent plane to the surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m>
at <m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0,y_0)\big)</m>, we can find a normal vector to
the tangent plane by taking their cross product. Their cross product is
<md>
<mrow>
\llt 1\,,\, 0\,,\, f_x(x_0,y_0)\rgt\times\llt 0\,,\, 1\,,\, f_y(x_0,y_0)\rgt
&amp;=\det\left[\begin{matrix}\hi&amp; \hj &amp;\hk \\
                   1 &amp; 0 &amp; f_x(x_0,y_0) \\
                   0 &amp; 1 &amp; f_y(x_0,y_0)\end{matrix}\right]
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=-f_x(x_0,y_0)\,\hi - f_y(x_0,y_0)\,\hj +\hk
</mrow>
</md>
and we have that the vector
<me>
-f_x(x_0,y_0)\,\hi - f_y(x_0,y_0)\,\hj +\hk
</me>
is perpendicular to the surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> at  <m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0,y_0)\big)</m>.
</p>

<p>The tangent plane to the surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> at <m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0,y_0)\big)</m>
is the plane through <m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0,y_0)\big)</m> with normal vector
<m>-f_x(x_0,y_0)\,\hi - f_y(x_0,y_0)\,\hj +\hk</m>. This plane has equation
<me>
-f_x(x_0,y_0)\,(x-x_0) - f_y(x_0,y_0)\,(y-y_0) +\big(z-f(x_0,y_0)\big) =0
</me>
or, after a little rearrangement,
<me>
z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)\,(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)\,(y-y_0)
</me>
Now that we have the normal vector, finding the equation of the normal line
to the surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> at the point <m>\big(x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,f(x_0,y_0)\big)</m>
is straightforward. Writing it in parametric form,
<me>
\llt x,y,z \rgt =  \llt x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0) \rgt
                 +t\llt -f_x(x_0,y_0)\,,\, - f_y(x_0,y_0)\,,\, 1 \rgt

That was pretty simple <mdash/> find the partial derivatives and substitute
in the coordinates. Let's do something a bit more challenging.
</p>


<example xml:id="eg_tan_plane_B"><title>Optional</title>
<statement>
<p>
Find the distance from <m>(0,3,0)</m>
to the surface <m>z=x^2+y^2</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
Write <m>f(x,y)=x^2+y^2</m>. Let's denote  by <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m> the point on <m>z=f(x,y)</m> that is nearest <m>(0,3,0)</m>.
Before we really get into the problem, let's make a simple sketch and think about what the lines from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to the surface look like and, in
particular, the angles between these lines and the surface.
</p>

<sidebyside width="40%">
<image source="figs/distanceBB"/>
<image source="figs/distanceB"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
The line from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m>,
the point on <m>z=f(x,y)</m> nearest <m>(0,3,0)</m>,
is distinguished from the other lines from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to the
surface, by being perpendicular to the surface.
We will provide a detailed justification for this claim below.
</p>

<p>Let's first exploit the fact that the vector
from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m> must be perpendicular to the surface
to determine <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m>, and consequently
the distance from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to the surface. By Theorem <xref ref="thm_tan_plane_f"/>.a,
with <m>x_0=a</m> and <m>y_0=b</m>, the vector
<me>
-f_x(a,b)\,\hi - f_y(a,b)\,\hj +\hk
=-2a\,\hi -2b\,\hj +\hk
\tag{$*$}</me>
is normal to the surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> at <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m>.
So the vector from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m>, namely
<me>
a\,\hi + (b-3)\,\hj + f(a,b)\,\hk
=a\,\hi + (b-3)\,\hj + (a^2+b^2)\,\hk
\tag{$**$}</me>
must be parallel to <m>(*)</m>. This does not force the vector <m>(*)</m> to
equal <m>(**)</m>, but it does force the existence of some number <m>t</m> obeying
<me>
a\,\hi + (b-3)\,\hj + (a^2+b^2)\,\hk
=t\big(-2a\,\hi -2b\,\hj +\hk\big)
</me>
or equivalently
<me>
\left\{\begin{aligned}
a&amp;=-2a\,t\\
b-3 &amp;= -2b\,t\\
a^2+b^2 &amp;= t
\end{aligned}\right.
</me>
We now have a system of three equations in the three unknowns <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>
and <m>t</m>. If we can solve them, we will have found the point on the surface
that we want.
<ul>
<li>
The first equation is <m>a(1+2t)=0</m> so that either <m>a=0</m> or <m>t=-\frac{1}{2}</m>.
</li>
<li>
The third equation forces <m>t\ge 0</m>, so <m>a=0</m>, and the last equation reduces to
<m>t=b^2</m>.
</li>
<li>
Substituting this into the middle equation gives
<me>
b-3=-2b^3\qquad\text{or equivalently}\qquad
2b^3+b-3 = 0
</me>
</li>
</ul>
In general, cubic equations are very hard to solve<fn>The method
for solving cubics was developed in the 15th century by
del Ferro, Cardano and Ferrari (Cardano's student). Ferrari then went
on to discover a formula for the roots of a quartic. Both the cubic and quartic
formulae are extremely cumbersome, and no such formula exists for
polynomials of degree 5 and higher. This is the famous Abel-Ruffini theorem.</fn>.
But, in this case,
we can guess one solution<fn>See Appendix A.16 in the
CLP-2 text. There it is shown that any integer root of a polynomial with
integer coefficients must divide the constant term exactly. So in this case
only <m>\pm 1</m> and <m>\pm 3</m> could be integer roots. So it good to check to
see if any of these are solutions before moving on to more sophisticated
techniques.</fn>, namely <m>b=1</m>. So <m>(b-1)</m>
must be a factor of <m>2b^3+b-3</m> and a little division then gives us
<me>
0=2b^3+b-3
=(b-1)(2b^2 +2b  +3)
</me>
We can now find the roots of the quadratic factor by using
the high school formula
<me>
\frac{-4\pm\sqrt{2^2-4(2)(3)}}{4}
</me>
Since <m>2^2-4(2)(3) \lt 0</m>, the factor <m>2b^2 +2b  +3</m> has no real roots.
So the only real solution to the cubic equation <m>2b^3+b-3 = 0</m>
is <m>b=1</m>.
</p>

<p>In summary,
<ul>
<li>
<m>a=0</m>, <m>b=1</m> and
</li>
<li>
the point on <m>z=x^2+y^2</m> nearest <m>(0,3,0)</m> is <m>(0,1,1)</m> and
</li>
<li>
the distance from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to <m>z=x^2+y^2</m> is the distance from
<m>(0,3,0)</m> to <m>(0,1,1)</m>, which is <m>\sqrt{(-2)^2+1^2}=\sqrt{5}</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Finally back to the claim that, because <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m>
is the point on <m>z=f(x,y)</m> that is nearest<fn>Note that we are assuming
that <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m> is the point on the surface that is nearest
<m>(0,3,0)</m>. That there exists such a point is intuitively obvious from
a sketch of the surface. The mathematical proof that there exists such
a point is beyond the scope of this text.</fn>
  <m>(0,3,0)</m>, the vector
from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m> must be perpendicular to the
surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> at <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m>.

Note that the square of the distance from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to a general point
<m>\big(x,y,f(x,y)\big)</m> on <m>z=f(x,y)</m> is
<me>
D(x,y) = x^2 + (y-3)^2 +f(x,y)^2
</me>
If <m>x=a</m>, <m>y=b</m> minimizes <m>D(x,y)</m> then, in particular,
<ul>
<li>
  restricting our attention to the slice <m>y=b</m> of the surface,
  <m>x=a</m> minimizes <m>g(x) = D(x,b) =x^2 + (b-3)^2 +f(x,b)^2</m> so that

      &amp;=2 \llt a\,,\,b-3\,,\, f(a,b)\rgt\cdot\llt 1\,,\,0\,,\, f_x(a,b)\rgt
  </mrow>
</md>
  and
</li>
<li>
  restricting our attention to the slice <m>x=a</m> of the surface,
  <m>y=b</m> minimizes <m>h(y) = D(a,y) =a^2 + (y-3)^2 +f(a,y)^2</m> so that
  <md>
<mrow>
    0 &amp;= h'(b) =\pdiff{}{y}\Big[a^2 + (y-3)^2 +f(a,y)^2\Big]\bigg|_{y=b}

  </mrow>
</md>
</li>
</ul>
We have expressed the final right hand sides of both of the above bullets
as the dot product of the vector <m>\llt a\,,\,b-3\,,\, f(a,b)\rgt</m>
with something because
<ul>
<li>
<m>\llt a\,,\,b-3\,,\, f(a,b)\rgt</m> is the vector from <m>(0,3,0)</m>
to the point <m>(a\,,\,b\,,\, f(a,b)\big)</m> on the surface and
</li>
<li> the vanishing of the dot product of two vectors
implies that the two vectors are perpendicular.
</li>
</ul>
Thus, that
<md>
<mrow>
\llt a\,,\,b-3\,,\, f(a,b)\rgt\cdot\llt 1\,,\,0\,,\, f_x(a,b)\rgt
&amp;=\llt a\,,\,b-3\,,\, f(a,b)\rgt\cdot\llt 0\,,\,1\,,\, f_y(a,b)\rgt
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
 tells us that the vector <m>\llt a\,,\,b-3\,,\, f(a,b)\rgt</m>
from <m>(0,3,0)</m> to <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m> is perpendicular to both
<m>\llt 1\,,\,0\,,\, f_x(a,b)\rgt</m> and <m>\llt 0\,,\,1\,,\, f_y(a,b)\rgt</m>
and hence is parallel to their cross product
<m>\llt 1\,,\, 0\,,\, f_x(a,b)\rgt\times\llt 0\,,\, 1\,,\, f_y(a,b)\rgt</m>,
which we already know is a normal vector to the surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> at
 <m>\big(a,b,f(a,b)\big)</m>.
</p>

<p>This shows that the point on the surface that minimises the distance
to <m>(0,3,0)</m> is joined to <m>(0,3,0)</m> by a line that is parallel to the
normal vector <mdash/> just as we require.

The limit

</p>
</warning>


<p>Now we'll move on to some more involved examples.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_tan_plane_E">
<p>
Suppose that we wish to find the highest and lowest points on the
surface <m>G(x,y,z) = x^2-2x +y^2-4y + z^2-6z = 2</m>. That is, we wish
to find the points on the surface with the maximum value of <m>z</m>
and with the minimum<fn>Recall that <q>minimum</q> means the most

        &amp;=(x-1)^2 +(y-2)^2 +(z-3)^2 - 14.
</mrow>
</md>
So the surface <m>G(x,y,z)=2</m> is a sphere, whose highest point is
the north pole and whose lowest point is the south pole. But let's
pretend that <m>G(x,y,z)=2</m> is some complicated surface that we can't
easily picture.
</p>

<p>We'll find its highest and lowest points by exploiting the
fact that the tangent plane to <m>G=2</m> is horizontal at the highest and lowest
points. Equivalently, the normal vector to <m>G=2</m> is vertical at the highest
and lowest points. To see that this is the case, look at the figure below.
If the tangent plane at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> is not horizontal, then the
tangent plane contains points near <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> with <m>z</m> bigger
than <m>z_0</m> and points near <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> with <m>z</m> smaller than <m>z_0</m>.
Near <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>, the tangent plane is a good approximation to the
surface. So the surface also contains<fn>While this is intuitively

 such points.

<p>
The gradient is
<me>
\vnabla G(x,y,z) = (2x-2)\,\hi + (2y-4)\,\hj + (2z-6)\,\hk
</me>
It is vertical when the <m>\hi</m> and <m>\hj</m> components are both zero.
This happens when <m>2x-2=0</m> and <m>2y-4=0</m>, i.e. when <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m>.
So the normal vector to the surface <m>G=2</m> at the point <m>(x,y,z)</m>
is vertical when <m>x=1</m>, <m>y=2</m> and (don't forget that <m>(x,y,z)</m> has to be

</p></example>

<p>
We could have short-cut the last example by using that the surface was
a sphere. Here is an example in the same spirit for which we don't have
an easy short-cut.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_tan_plane_F">
<p>
In the last example, we found the points on a specified surface
having the largest and smallest values of <m>z</m>. We'll now ramp up the
level of difficulty a bit and find the points on the surface
<m>x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72</m> that have the largest and smallest values of
<m>x+y+3z</m>.
</p>

<p>To develop a strategy for tackling this problem, consider the
following sketch.
</p>

<sidebyside width="75%">
<image source="figs/bigSmall"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
The red ellipse in the sketch is intended to represent (schematically)
our surface
<me>
x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72
</me>
which is an ellipsoid. The middle
diagonal (black) line is intended to represent (schematically)
the plane <m>x+y+3z=C</m> for some more or less randomly chosen value of
the constant C.
At each point on that plane, the function, <m>x+y+3z</m>, (that we are trying
to maximize and minimize) takes the value <m>C</m>.
In particular, for the <m>C</m> chosen in the figure, <m>x+y+3z=C</m> does intersect
our surface, indicating that <m>x+y+3z</m> does indeed take the value <m>C</m>
somewhere on our surface.
</p>

<p>To maximize <m>x+y+3z</m>, imagine slowly increasing the value of <m>C</m>.
As we do so, the plane <m>x+y+3z=C</m> moves to the right. We want to stop
increasing <m>C</m> at the biggest value of <m>C</m> for which the plane <m>x+y+3z=C</m>
intersects our surface <m>x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72</m>. For that value of <m>C</m>
the plane <m>x+y+3z=C</m>, which is represented by the right hand blue line
in the sketch, is tangent to our surface.
</p>

<p>Similarly, to minimize <m>x+y+3z</m>, imagine slowly decreasing the value of <m>C</m>.
As we do so, the plane <m>x+y+3z=C</m> moves to the left. We want to stop
decreasing <m>C</m> at the smallest value of <m>C</m> for which the plane <m>x+y+3z=C</m>
intersects our surface <m>x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72</m>. For that value of <m>C</m>
the plane <m>x+y+3z=C</m>, which is represented by the left hand blue line
in the sketch, is again tangent to our surface. The previous
Example <xref ref="eg_tan_plane_E"/> was similar, except that the plane was
<m>z=C</m>.
</p>

<p>We are now ready to compute. We need to find the points <m>(a,b,c)</m>
(in the sketch, they are the black dot points of tangency) for which
<ul>
<li> <m>(a,b,c)</m> is on the surface and
</li>
<li> the normal vector to the surface <m>x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72</m>
         at <m>(a,b,c)</m> is parallel to <m>\llt 1,1,3\rgt</m>, which is
         a normal vector to the plane <m>x+y+3z=C</m>
</li>
</ul>
Since the gradient of <m>x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2</m> is
<m>\llt 2x\,,\,4y\,,\,6z\rgt=2\llt x\,,\,2y\,,\,3z\rgt</m>,
these two conditions are, in equations,
<md>
<mrow>
a^2+ 2b^2 +3c^2 &amp;= 72
</mrow><mrow>
\llt a\,,\,2b\,,\,3c\rgt &amp;=t \llt 1,1,3\rgt\qquad
\text{for some number } t
</mrow>
</md>
The second equation says that <m>a=t</m>, <m>b=\frac{t}{2}</m> and <m>c=t</m>.
Substituting this into the first equation gives
<md>
<mrow>
t^2+ \frac{1}{2}t^2 +3t^2 &amp;= 72
\iff \frac{9}{2}t^2=72
\iff t^2 = 16
\iff t=\pm 4
</mrow>
</md>
So
<ul>
<li>
the point on the surface  <m>x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72</m> at which
<m>x+y+3z</m> takes its maximum value is <m>(a,b,c) = \big(t,\frac{t}{2},t\big)\Big|_{t=4}=(4,2,4)</m> and
</li>
<li>
<m>x+y+3z</m> takes the value <m>4+2+3\times 4 =18</m> there.
</li>
<li>
The point on the surface  <m>x^2+ 2y^2 +3z^2 = 72</m> at which

<statement>
<p>
Let <m>F(x,y,z)=0</m> and <m>G(x,y,z)=0</m> be two surfaces. These two surfaces
intersect along a curve.
Find a tangent vector to this curve at the point <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
Call the tangent vector <m>\vT</m>. Then <m>\vT</m> has to be
<ul>
<li>
tangent to the surface  <m>F(x,y,z)=0</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> and
</li>
<li>
tangent to the surface  <m>G(x,y,z)=0</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Consequently <m>\vT</m> has to be
<ul>
<li>
perpendicular to the vector <m>\vnabla F(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>, which is
normal to  <m>F(x,y,z)=0</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>, and at the same time has to be
</li>
<li>
perpendicular to the vector <m>\vnabla G(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>, which is
normal to  <m>G(x,y,z)=0</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Recall that an easy way to construct a vector that is perpendicular to
two other vectors is to take their cross product. So we take

where all partial derivatives are evaluated at <m>(x,y,z)=(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>.
</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>Let's put Example <xref ref="eg_tan_plane_H"/> into action.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_tan_plane_I">
<statement>
<p>
Consider the curve that is the intersection of the surfaces
<me>
x^2+y^2+z^2=5\qquad\text{and}\qquad
x^2+y^2=4z
</me>
Find a tangent vector to this curve
at the point <m>\big(\sqrt{3}\,,\,1\,,\,1\big)</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
As a preliminary check, we verify that the point <m>\big(\sqrt{3}\,,\,1\,,\,1\big)</m> really is on the curve. To do so,
we check that <m>\big(\sqrt{3}\,,\,1\,,\,1\big)</m> satisfies both equations:
<me>
\big(\sqrt{3}\big)^2+1^2+1^2=5\qquad
\big(\sqrt{3}\big)^2+1^2=4\times 1
</me>
We'll find the specified tangent vector by using the strategy of
Example <xref ref="eg_tan_plane_H"/>.
</p>

<p>Write <m>F(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2+z^2</m>
and <m>G(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2-4z</m>. Then
<ul>
<li>
the vector
<me>
\vnabla F(\sqrt{3},1,1)
 =\llt 2x\,,\,2y\,,\,2z \rgt\Big|_{(x,y,z)=(\sqrt{3},1,1)}
 = 2\llt \sqrt{3}\,,\,1\,,\,1 \rgt
</me>
is normal to the surface <m>F(x,y,z)</m> at <m>\big(\sqrt{3}\,,\,1\,,\,1\big)</m>,
and
</li>
<li>
the vector
<me>
\vnabla G(\sqrt{3},1,1)
 =\llt 2x\,,\,2y\,,\,-4 \rgt\Big|_{(x,y,z)=(\sqrt{3},1,1)}
 = 2\llt \sqrt{3}\,,\,1\,,\,-2 \rgt
</me>
is normal to the surface <m>G(x,y,z)</m> at <m>\big(\sqrt{3}\,,\,1\,,\,1\big)</m>.
</li>
</ul>
So a tangent vector is
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;\llt \sqrt{3}\,,\,1\,,\,1 \rgt\times \llt \sqrt{3}\,,\,1\,,\,-2 \rgt
    =\det\left[\begin{matrix}
                 \hi &amp; \hj &amp; \hk \\
            \sqrt{3} &amp;  1  &amp; 1 \\
            \sqrt{3} &amp;  1  &amp; -2 \end{matrix}\right]
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\hskip0.5in =\big(-2-1\big)\,\hi + \big(\sqrt{3}+2\sqrt{3}\big)\,\hj
    +\big(\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{3}\big)\,\hk

&amp;\hskip0.5in= -3\,\hi + 3\sqrt{3}\,\hj
</mrow>
</md>
There is an easy common factor of <m>3</m> in both components. So
we can create a slightly neater tangent vector by dividing the length
of <m>-3\,\hi + 3\sqrt{3}\,\hj</m> by <m>3</m>, giving  <m>\llt -1\,,\,\sqrt{3}\,,\,0\rgt</m>.

<p>Tangent planes, in addition to being geometric objects, provide a
simple but powerful tool for approximating functions of two variables
near a specified point. We saw something very similar in the CLP-1 text
where we approximated functions of one variable by their tangent lines.
This brings us to our next topic <mdash/> approximating functions.

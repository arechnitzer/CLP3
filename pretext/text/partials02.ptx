<title>Partial Derivatives</title>
<introduction>
<p>We are now ready to define derivatives of functions of more than one variable.
First, recall how we defined the derivative, <m>f'(a)</m>, of a function
of one variable, <m>f(x)</m>. We imagined that we were walking along the <m>x</m>-axis,
in the positive direction, measuring, for example, the temperature
along the way. We denoted by <m>f(x)</m> the temperature at <m>x</m>. The instantaneous rate of change of temperature that we observed as we passed through <m>x=a</m> was
<me>
\diff{f}{x}(a) =\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
      =\lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}
</me>
</p>

<p>Next suppose that we are walking in the <m>xy</m>-plane and that the temperature
at <m>(x,y)</m> is <m>f(x,y)</m>. We can pass through the point <m>(x,y)=(a,b)</m> moving
in many different directions, and we cannot expect the measured rate of
change of temperature if we walk parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis, in the
direction of increasing <m>x</m>, to be the same as the measured rate of change of temperature if we walk parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis in the direction of increasing <m>y</m>. We'll start by considering just those two directions. We'll consider
other directions (like walking parallel to the line <m>y=x</m>) later.
</p>

<p>Suppose that we are passing through the point <m>(x,y)=(a,b)</m> and that
we are walking parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis (in the positive direction).
Then our <m>y</m>-coordinate will be constant, always taking the value <m>y=b</m>.
So we can think of the measured temperature as the function of one
variable <m>B(x) = f(x,b)</m> and we will observe the rate of change of temperature
<me>
\diff{B}{x}(a) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{B(a+h) - B(a)}{h}
      = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h}
</me>
This is called the <q>partial derivative <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m> at <m>(a,b)</m></q>
and is denoted <m>\pdiff{f}{x}(a,b)</m>. Here
<ul>
<li>
the symbol <m>\partial</m>, which is read <q>partial</q>, indicates that
we are dealing with a function of more than one variable, and
</li>
<li>
the <m>x</m> in <m>{\pdiff{f}{x}}</m> indicates that we are differentiating
with respect to <m>x</m>, while <m>y</m> is being held fixed, i.e. being treated as a constant.
</li>
<li>
<m>{\pdiff{f}{x}}</m> is read <q> partial dee <m>f</m> dee <m>x</m></q>.
</li>
</ul>
Do not write <m>\diff{}{x}</m> when <m>\pdiff{}{x}</m> is appropriate.
We shall later encounter situations when <m>\diff{}{x}f</m> and
<m>\pdiff{}{x}f</m> are both defined and have different meanings.
</p>

<p>If, instead, we are passing through the point <m>(x,y)=(a,b)</m> and
are walking parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis (in the positive direction),
then our <m>x</m>-coordinate will be constant, always taking the value <m>x=a</m>.
So we can think of the measured temperature as the function of one
variable <m>A(y) = f(a,y)</m> and we will observe the rate of change of temperature
<me>
\diff{A}{y}(b) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{A(b+h) - A(b)}{h}
      = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a,b+h) - f(a,b)}{h}
</me>
This is called the <q>partial derivative <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m> at <m>(a,b)</m></q>
and is denoted <m>\pdiff{f}{y}(a,b)</m>.
</p>

<p>Just as was the case for the ordinary derivative <m>\diff{f}{x}(x)</m>
(see Definition 2.2.6 in the CLP-1 text),
it is common to treat the partial derivatives of <m>f(x,y)</m> as functions
of <m>(x,y)</m> simply by evaluating the partial derivatives at <m>(x,y)</m> rather
than at <m>(a,b)</m>.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def_partials"><title>Partial Derivatives</title>
<statement><p>
The <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-partial derivatives of the function <m>f(x,y)</m>

respectively. The partial derivatives of functions of more than two variables
are defined analogously.
</p></statement>
</definition>


<p>Partial derivatives are used a lot. And there many notations for them.</p>

<definition xml:id="notn_partial">
<statement><p>
The partial derivative <m>\pdiff{f}{x}(x,y)</m> of a function <m>f(x,y)</m> is also denoted
<me>
\pdiff{f}{x}\qquad
f_x(x,y)\qquad
f_x\qquad
D_xf(x,y)\qquad
D_xf\qquad
D_1 f(x,y)\qquad
D_1 f
</me>
The subscript <m>1</m> on <m>D_1 f</m> indicates that <m>f</m> is being differentiated with respect to its first variable.
The partial derivative <m>\pdiff{f}{x}(a,b)</m> is also denoted
<me>
\pdiff{f}{x}\bigg|_{(a,b)}
</me>
with the subscript <m>(a,b)</m> indicating that <m>\pdiff{f}{x}</m> is being evaluated
at <m>(x,y)=(a,b)</m>.
</p>

<p>
The notation <m>{\left(\pdiff{f}{x}\right)}_{\!y}</m> is used to make explicit
that the variable <m>y</m> is being held.
<fn>
  There are applications in which there are several variables that cannot be varied independently. For example, the pressure, volume and temperature of an ideal gas are related by the equation of state <m>PV= \text{(constant)} T</m>. In those applications, it may not be clear from the context which variables are being held fixed.</fn>
</p>
</statement>
</definition>


<remark xml:id="rem_geom_interp"><title>The Geometric Interpretation of Partial Derivatives</title>
<p>
We'll now develop a geometric interpretation of the partial derivative
<me>
\pdiff{f}{x}(a,b)  = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h}
</me>
in terms of the shape of the graph <m>z=f(x,y)</m> of the function <m>f(x,y)</m>.
That graph appears in the figure below. It looks like the part of
a deformed sphere that is in the first octant.
</p>

<p>The definition of <m>\pdiff{f}{x}(a,b)</m> concerns
only points on the graph that have <m>y=b</m>.
In other words, the curve of intersection of the
surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> with the plane <m>y=b</m>. That is the red curve in the figure.
The two blue vertical line segments in the figure have heights <m>f(a,b)</m> and
<m>f(a+h,b)</m>, which are the two numbers in the numerator
of <m>\frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h}</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="80%">
<image source="figs/xderiv"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
A side view of the curve (looking from the left side of the <m>y</m>-axis)
is sketched in the figure below.
</p>

<sidebyside width="70%">
<image source="figs/xderivSide"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
  Again, the two blue vertical line segments
in the figure have heights <m>f(a,b)</m> and <m>f(a+h,b)</m>, which are the two
numbers in the numerator of <m>\frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h}</m>. So
the numerator <m>f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)</m> and denominator <m>h</m> are the rise and run,
respectively, of the curve <m>z=f(x,b)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=a+h</m>. Thus
<m>\pdiff{f}{x}(a,b)</m> is exactly
<em>the slope of (the tangent to) the curve of intersection of the surface
<m>z=f(x,y)</m> and the plane <m>y=b</m> at the point <m>\big(a,b, f(a,b)\big)</m>.</em>
In the same way
<m>\pdiff{f}{y}(a,b)</m> is exactly
<em>the slope of (the tangent to) the curve of intersection of the surface
<m>z=f(x,y)</m> and the plane <m>x=a</m> at the point <m>\big(a,b, f(a,b)\big)</m>.</em>

  <title>Evaluation of Partial Derivatives</title>

<p>
From the above discussion, we see that we can readily compute partial
derivatives <m>\pdiff{}{x}</m> by using what we already know about ordinary
derivatives <m>\diff{}{x}</m>. More precisely,
<ul>
<li>
to evaluate <m>\pdiff{f}{x}(x,y)</m>, treat the <m>y</m> in <m>f(x,y)</m> as a constant
and differentiate the resulting function of <m>x</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.

Then evaluate the result at <m>x=a</m>, <m>y=b</m>.

Now for some examples.

Let's move up to a function of four variables. Things generalize
in a quite straight forward way.

</p>
</example>

<p>
Now here is a more complicated example <mdash/> our function takes a special
value at <m>(0,0)</m>. To compute derivatives there we have to revert to
the definition.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_partials_D">
<p>
Set
<me>
f(x,y)=\begin{cases}
             \frac{\cos x-\cos y}{x-y}&amp;\text{if } x\ne y \\
                    0&amp;\text{if } x=y

</me>
If <m>b\ne a</m>, then for all <m>(x,y)</m> sufficiently close to <m>(a,b)</m>,
<m>f(x,y) = \frac{\cos x-\cos y}{x-y}</m> and we can compute the
partial derivatives of <m>f</m> at <m>(a,b)</m> using the familiar rules of
differentiation. However that is not the case for <m>(a,b)=(0,0)</m>.
To evaluate <m>f_x(0,0)</m>, we need to set <m>y=0</m> and find the derivative of
<me>
f(x,0) = \begin{cases}
             \frac{\cos x-1}{x}&amp;\text{if } x\ne 0 \
                    0&amp;\text{if } x=0
        \end{cases}
</me>
with respect to <m>x</m> at <m>x=0</m>. To do so, we basically have to apply the
definition
<md>

We could also evaluate the limit of <m>\frac{\cos h-1}{h^2} </m>
by substituting in the Taylor expansion
<me>
\cos h = 1 -\frac{h^2}{2}+\frac{h^4}{4!} -\cdots

</p>
</example>

<example xml:id="eg_partials_DDD"><title>Optional <mdash/> A Little Weirdness</title>
<p>
In this example, we will see that the function

f(x,y)=\begin{cases}
             \frac{x^2}{x-y}&amp;\text{if } x\ne y \\
                    0&amp;\text{if } x=y

</me>
is <em>not</em> continuous at <m>(0,0)</m> and yet has both partial derivatives
<m>f_x(0,0)</m> and <m>f_y(0,0)</m> perfectly well defined. We'll also see how that is possible. First let's compute the partial derivatives. By definition,
<md>
<mrow>
f_x(0,0)&amp;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(0+h,0)-f(0,0)}{h}
         =\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\overbrace{\tfrac{h^2}{h-0}}^{h}-\,0}{h}
         =\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}1
</mrow><mrow>
         &amp;=1
</mrow><mrow>
f_y(0,0)&amp;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(0,0+h)-f(0,0)}{h}
         =\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\frac{0^2}{0-h}-0}{h}
         =\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}0
</mrow><mrow>
         &amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
So the first order partial derivatives <m>f_x(0,0)</m> and <m>f_y(0,0)</m> are perfectly well defined.
</p>

<p>To see that, nonetheless, <m>f(x,y)</m> is not continuous at <m>(0,0)</m>, we take the limit of <m>f(x,y)</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(0,0)</m> along the curve <m>y=x-x^3</m>.
The limit is
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} f\big(x,x-x^3\big)
=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2}{x-(x-x^3)}
=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{x}
</mrow>
</md>
which does not exist. Indeed as <m>x</m> approoaches <m>0</m> through positive numbers,
<m>\frac{1}{x}</m> approaches <m>+\infty</m>, and as <m>x</m> approoaches <m>0</m> through negative
numbers, <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> approaches <m>-\infty</m>.
</p>

<p>So how is this possible? The answer is that <m>f_x(0,0)</m> only involves values of <m>f(x,y)</m> with <m>y=0</m>. As <m>f(x,0)=x</m>, for all values of <m>x</m>, we have that
<m>f(x,0)</m> is a continuous, and indeed a differentiable, function. Similarly,
<m>f_y(0,0)</m> only involves values of <m>f(x,y)</m> with <m>x=0</m>. As <m>f(0,y)=0</m>, for all values of <m>y</m>, we have that <m>f(0,y)</m> is a continuous, and indeed a
differentiable, function. On the other hand, the bad behaviour of <m>f(x,y)</m> for <m>(x,y)</m> near
<m>(0,0)</m> only happens for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> both nonzero.
</p>

</example>

<p>
  Our next example uses implicit differentiation.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_partials_E">
<p>
The equation
<me>
z^5 + y^2 e^z +e^{2x}=0

implicitly determines <m>z</m> as a function of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
That is, the function <m>z(x,y)</m> obeys
<me>
z(x,y)^5 + y^2 e^{z(x,y)} +e^{2x}=0
</me>
For example, when <m>x=y=0</m>, the equation reduces to

5z(x,y)^4\ \pdiff{z}{x}(x,y) + y^2 e^{z(x,y)}\ \pdiff{z}{x}(x,y) +2e^{2x}  =0

5z(0,0)^4\ \pdiff{z}{x}(0,0) +2  =0

Next we have a partial derivative disguised as a limit.

<example xml:id="eg_partials_F">
<p>
In this example we are going to evaluate the limit
<me>
\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\frac{(x+y+z)^3-(x+y)^3}{(x+y)z}
</me>
The critical observation is that, in taking the limit <m>z\rightarrow 0</m>,
<m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are fixed. They do not change as <m>z</m> is getting smaller and
smaller. Furthermore this limit is exactly of the form of the limits
in the Definition <xref ref="def_partials"/> of partial derivative, disguised by some
obfuscating changes of notation.
</p>

<p>Set
<me>
f(x,y,z) = \frac{(x+y+z)^3}{(x+y)}
</me>
Then
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\frac{(x+y+z)^3-(x+y)^3}{(x+y)z}
&amp;=\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x,y,z)-f(x,y,0)}{z}

&amp;={\left[\pdiff{}{z}\frac{(x+y+z)^3}{x+y}\right]}_{z=0}
</mrow>
</md>
Recalling that <m>\pdiff{}{z}</m> treats <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as constants,
we are evaluating the derivative of a function of the form
<m>\frac{({\rm const}+z)^3}{\rm const}</m>. So
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\frac{(x+y+z)^3-(x+y)^3}{(x+y)z}

<p>The next example highlights a potentially dangerous difference between
ordinary and partial derivatives.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_partials_G">
<p>
In this example we are going to see that, in contrast to the ordinary
derivative case, <m>\pdiff{r}{x}</m> is not, in general, the same as
<m>\big(\pdiff{x}{r}\big)^{-1}</m>.
</p>

<p>
  Recall that Cartesian and polar coordinates (for <m>(x,y)\ne (0,0)</m> and <m>r \gt 0</m>)
are related by

<p>
We will use the functions
<me>
x(r,\theta) = r\cos\theta\qquad
\text{and}\qquad
r(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}
</me>
Fix any point <m>(x_0,y_0)\ne (0,0)</m> and let
<m>(r_0,\theta_0)</m>, <m>0\le\theta_0 \lt 2\pi</m>, be the corresponding polar coordinates.
Then
<md>
<mrow>
\pdiff{x}{r}(r,\theta) = \cos\theta\qquad
\pdiff{r}{x}(x,y) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}
</mrow>
</md>
so that
<md>
<mrow>
\pdiff{x}{r}(r_0,\theta_0)=\left(\pdiff{r}{x}(x_0,y_0)\right)^{-1}
&amp;\iff \cos\theta_0= \bigg(\frac{x_0}{\sqrt{x_0^2+y_0^2}}\bigg)^{-1}

</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\iff \cos^2\theta_0= 1
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\iff \theta_0=0,\pi
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>We can also see pictorially why this happens.
By definition, the partial derivatives
<md>
<mrow>
\pdiff{x}{r}(r_0,\theta_0)
  &amp;= \lim_{\dee{r}\rightarrow 0}
         \frac{x(r_0+\dee{r},\theta_0) - x(r_0,\theta_0)}{\dee{r}}

         \frac{r(x_0+\dee{x},y_0) - r(x_0,y_0)}{\dee{x}}
</mrow>
</md>
Here we have just renamed the <m>h</m> of Definition <xref ref="def_partials"/>
to <m>\dee{r}</m> and to <m>\dee{x}</m> in the two definitions.
</p>

<p>In computing <m>\pdiff{x}{r}(r_0,\theta_0)</m>, <m>\theta_0</m> is held
fixed, <m>r</m> is changed by a small amount <m>\dee{r}</m> and the resulting
<m>\dee{x}=x(r_0+\dee{r},\theta_0) - x(r_0,\theta_0)</m> is computed.
In the figure on the left below, <m>\dee{r}</m> is the length of the orange
line segment and <m>\dee{x}</m> is the length of the blue line segment.

<sidebyside width="40%">

<p>
On the other hand, in computing <m>\pdiff{r}{x}</m>, <m>y</m> is held fixed,
<m>x</m> is changed by a small amount <m>\dee{x}</m> and the resulting
<m>\dee{r}=r(x_0+\dee{x},y_0) - r(x_0,y_0)</m>  is computed. In the figure on
the right above, <m>\dee{x}</m> is the length of the pink line segment and
<m>\dee{r}</m> is the length of the orange line segment.
</p>

<p>Here are the two figures combined together. We have arranged that the same
<m>\dee{r}</m> is used in both computations. In order for the <m>\dee{r}</m>'s to
be the same in both computations, the two <m>\dee{x}</m>'s have to be different
(unless <m>\theta_0=0,\pi</m>). So, in general,
<m>\pdiff{x}{r}(r_0,\theta_0)\ne \big(\pdiff{r}{x}(x_0,y_0)\big)^{-1}</m>.

<example xml:id="eg_partials_GG"><title>Optional <mdash/> Example <xref ref="eg_partials_G"/>, continued</title>
<p>
The inverse function theorem, for functions of one variable, says that,
if <m>y(x)</m> and <m>x(y)</m> are inverse functions, meaning that <m>y\big(x(y)\big)=y</m>
and <m>x\big(y(x)\big)=x</m>, and are differentiable with <m>\diff{y}{x}\ne 0</m>, then
<me>
\diff{x}{y}(y) = \frac{1}{\diff{y}{x}\big(x(y)\big)}
</me>
To see this, just apply <m>\diff{}{y}</m> to both sides of <m>y\big(x(y)\big)=y</m>
to get <m>\diff{y}{x}\big(x(y)\big)\ \diff{x}{y}(y)=1</m>, by the chain rule
(see Theorem 2.9.3 in the CLP-1 text).
In the CLP-1 text, we used this to compute the derivatives of the logarithm
(see Theorem 2.10.1 in the CLP-1 text) and
of the inverse trig functions (see Theorem 2.12.7
in the CLP-1 text).
</p>

<p>We have just seen, in Example <xref ref="eg_partials_G"/>, that we can't be too naive in extending the single variable inverse function theorem to functions of two (or more) variables. On the other hand, there is such an extension, which we will now illustrate, using Cartesian and polar coordinates. For simplicity, we'll restrict our attention to <m>x \gt 0</m>, <m>y \gt 0</m>, or equivalently, <m>r \gt 0</m>, <m>0 \lt \theta \lt \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
The functions which convert between Cartesian and polar coordinates are

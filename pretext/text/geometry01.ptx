<title>Points</title>

<p>Each point in two dimensions may be labeled by two coordinates<fn>This is why the <m>xy</m>-plane is called <q>two dimensional</q> <mdash/> the name of each point consists of two real numbers.</fn><m>(x,y)</m> which specify the position of the point in some units with respect to some axes as in the figure below.

  The set of all points in two dimensions is denoted<fn>
    Not surprisingly, the <m>2</m> in <m>\bbbr^2</m> signifies that each point is labelled by two numbers and the <m>\bbbr</m> in <m>\bbbr^2</m> signifies that the numbers in question are real numbers.
    There are more advanced applications (for example in signal analysis and in quantum mechanics) where complex numbers are used. The space of all pairs <m>(z_1,z_2)</m>, with <m>z_1</m> and <m>z_2</m> complex numbers is denoted  <m>\bbbc^2</m>.
  </fn> <m>\bbbr^2</m>.
  Observe that
  <ul>
  <li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y)</m> to the <m>x</m>-axis is <m>|y|</m>
  </li>
  <li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y)</m> to the <m>y</m>-axis is <m>|x|</m>
  </li>
  <li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y)</m> to the origin <m>(0,0)</m> is
       <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m>
  </li>
  </ul>
  Similarly, each point in three dimensions may be labeled by three coordinates <m>(x,y,z)</m>, as in the two figures below.

  The set of all points in three dimensions is denoted <m>\bbbr^3</m>.
  The plane that contains, for example, the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes
  is called the <m>xy</m>-plane.
  <ul>
  <li> The <m>xy</m>-plane is the set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that
  satisfy <m>z=0</m>.
  </li>
  <li> The <m>xz</m>-plane is the set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that
  satisfy <m>y=0</m>.
  </li>
  <li> The <m>yz</m>-plane is the set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that
  satisfy <m>x=0</m>.
  </li>
  </ul>
  More generally,
  <ul>
  <li> The set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that obey <m>z=c</m> is a plane
  that is parallel to the <m>xy</m>-plane and is a distance <m>|c|</m> from it.
  If <m>c \gt 0</m>, the plane <m>z=c</m> is above the <m>xy</m>-plane.
  If <m>c \lt 0</m>, the plane <m>z=c</m> is below the <m>xy</m>-plane.
  We say that the plane <m>z=c</m> is a signed distance <m>c</m> from the
  <m>xy</m>-plane.
  </li>
  <li> The set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that obey <m>y=b</m> is a plane
  that is parallel to the <m>xz</m>-plane and is a signed distance <m>b</m> from it.
  </li>
  <li> The set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> that obey <m>x=a</m> is a plane
  that is parallel to the <m>yz</m>-plane and is a signed distance <m>a</m> from it.
  </li>
  </ul>

  Observe that our 2d distances extend quite easily to 3d.
  <ul>
  <li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the <m>xy</m>-plane is <m>|z|</m>
  </li>
  <li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the <m>xz</m>-plane is <m>|y|</m>
  </li>
  <li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the <m>yz</m>-plane is <m>|x|</m>
  </li>
  <li> the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the origin <m>(0,0,0)</m> is
       <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}</m>
  </li>
  </ul>
  To see that the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the origin <m>(0,0,0)</m>
  is indeed  <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}</m>,
  <ul>
  <li>
  apply Pythagoras to the right-angled triangle with vertices <m>(0,0,0)</m>,
  <m>(x,0,0)</m> and <m>(x,y,0)</m> to see that the distance from <m>(0,0,0)</m>
  to <m>(x,y,0)</m> is <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m> and then
  </li>
  <li>
  apply Pythagoras to the right-angled triangle with vertices <m>(0,0,0)</m>,
  <m>(x,y,0)</m> and <m>(x,y,z)</m> to see that the distance from <m>(0,0,0)</m>
  to <m>(x,y,z)</m> is <m>\sqrt{{\big(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\big)}^2+z^2}
  =\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}</m>.
  </li>
  </ul>

  More generally, the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the point
  <m>(x',y',z')</m> is
  <me>
  \sqrt{(x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+(z-z')^2}
  </me>
  Notice that this gives us the equation for a sphere quite directly.
  All the points on a sphere are equidistant from the centre of the sphere.
  So, for example, the equation of the sphere centered on <m>(1,2,3)</m> with
  radius <m>4</m>, that is, the set of all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> whose distance
  from <m>(1,2,3)</m> is <m>4</m>, is
  <me>
  (x-1)^2+(y-2)^2+(z-3)^2=16
  </me>

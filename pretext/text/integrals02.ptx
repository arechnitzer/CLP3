<title>Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates</title>
<introduction>

<p>So far, in setting up integrals, we have always cut up the
domain of integration into tiny rectangles by drawing in many lines
of constant <m>x</m> and many lines of constant <m>y</m>.

There is no law that says that we must cut up our domains of integration
into tiny pieces in that way. Indeed, when the objects of interest
are sort of round and centered on the origin, it is often
advantageous<fn>The <q>golden hammer</q> (also known as Maslow's hammer
and as the law of the instrument) refers to a tendency to always use
the same tool, even when it isn't the best tool for the job.
It is just as bad in mathematics as it is in carpentry.</fn>
to use polar coordinates, rather than Cartesian coordinates.

The following two figures show a number of lines of constant <m>\theta</m>,

<p>Note that the polar angle <m>\theta</m> is only defined up to integer multiples
of <m>2\pi</m>. For example, the point <m>(1,0)</m> on the <m>x</m>-axis could have
<m>\theta=0</m>, but could also have <m>\theta=2\pi</m> or <m>\theta=4\pi</m>. It is sometimes
convenient to assign <m>\theta</m> negative values. When <m>\theta \lt 0</m>, the
counter-clockwise<fn>or anti-clockwise or widdershins.
Yes, widdershins is a real word, though the Oxford English Dictionary
lists its frequency of usage as between 0.01 and 0.1 times
per million words. Of course both <q>counter-clockwise</q>
and <q>anti-clockwise</q> assume that your clock is not a sundial in the
southern hemisphere.</fn>
angle <m>\theta</m> refers to the clockwise angle <m>|\theta|</m>. For example,
the point <m>(0,-1)</m> on the negative <m>y</m>-axis can have <m>\theta=-\frac{\pi}{2}</m>
and can also have <m>\theta=\frac{3\pi}{2}</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="50%">

<p>It is also sometimes convenient to extend the above definitions by saying that
<m>x=r\cos\theta</m> and <m>y=r\sin\theta</m> even when <m>r</m> is negative. For example,
the following figure shows <m>(x,y)</m> for <m>r=1</m>, <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}</m>
and for <m>r=-1</m>, <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}</m>.

<p>
Both points lie on the  line through the origin that makes an angle of
<m>45^\circ</m> with the <m>x</m>-axis and both are a distance one from the origin.
But they are on opposite sides of the the origin.

<subsection xml:id="sec_polar_curves">
  <title>Polar Curves</title>


<p>Here are a couple of examples in which we sketch curves specified
by equations in terms of polar coordinates.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_cardioid"><title>The Cardioid</title>
<p>
Let's sketch the curve
<me>
r= 1+\cos\theta
</me>
Our starting point will be to understand how <m>1+\cos\theta</m> varies with <m>\theta</m>.
So it will be helpful to
remember what the graph of <m>\cos\theta</m> looks like for <m>0\le\theta\le 2\pi</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="50%">
<image source="figs/cosGraph"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
From this we see that the graph of <m>y=1+\cos\theta</m> is
</p>

<sidebyside width="55%">
<image source="figs/cosGraphP1"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
Now let's pick some easy <m>\theta</m> values, find the corresponding <m>r</m>'s
and sketch them.
</p>

<p><ul>
<li>
When <m>\theta=0</m>, we have <m>r=1+\cos 0 = 1+1=2</m>. To sketch the
point with <m>\theta=0</m> and <m>r=2</m>, we first draw in the half-line consisting
of all points with <m>\theta=0</m>, <m>r \gt 0</m>. That's the positive <m>x</m>-axis,
sketched in gray in the leftmost figure below. Then we put in a dot on that line
a distance <m>2</m> from the origin. That's the red dot in the first figure below.
</li>
<li><p>
Now increase <m>\theta</m> a bit (to another easy place to evaluate),
say to <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{6}</m>.
As we do so <m>r=1+\cos\theta</m> decreases to
<m>r=1+\cos\frac{\pi}{6} = 1+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\approx 1.87</m>.
To sketch the point with <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{6}</m> and <m>r\approx 1.87</m>,
we first draw in the half-line consisting of all points with <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{6}</m>, <m>r \gt 0</m>.
That's the upper gray line in the second figure below.
Then we put in a dot on that line a distance <m>1.87</m> from the origin.
That's the upper red dot in the second figure below.
</p>

<sidebyside widths="28% 28%">
    <image source="figs/cardioid1"/>
    <image source="figs/cardioid2"/>
</sidebyside>

<sidebyside width="40%">
    <image source="figs/cardioid3"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
<li><p>
Now increase <m>\theta</m> still more, say to
<ul>
<li>
          <m>\theta=\frac{2\pi}{6}=\frac{\pi}{3}</m>,
</li>
<li>
          followed by <m>\theta=\frac{3\pi}{6}=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
</li>
<li>
          followed by <m>\theta=\frac{4\pi}{6}=\frac{2\pi}{3}</m>,
</li>
<li>
          followed by <m>\theta=\frac{5\pi}{6}</m>,
</li>
<li>
          followed by <m>\theta=\frac{6\pi}{6}=\pi</m>.
</li>
</ul>
As <m>\theta</m> increases, <m>r=1+\cos\theta</m> decreases, hitting <m>r=1</m> when
<m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and ending at <m>r=0</m> when <m>\theta=\pi</m>.
For each of these <m>\theta</m>'s,  we first draw in the half-line consisting
of all points with that <m>\theta</m> and <m>r\ge 0</m>.
Those are the five gray lines in the figure on the right above.
Then we put in a dot on each <m>\theta</m>-line a distance <m>r=1+\cos\theta</m>
from the origin. Those are the red dots on the gray lines in the
figure on the right above.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
We could continue the above procedure for <m>\pi\le\theta\le 2\pi</m>.
Or we can look at the graph of <m>\cos\theta</m> above and notice that
the graph of <m>\cos\theta</m> for <m>\pi\le\theta\le 2\pi</m>
is exactly the mirror image, about <m>\theta=\pi</m>, of the graph of <m>\cos\theta</m>
for <m>0\le\theta\le \pi</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="55%">
<image source="figs/cosGraphR"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
That is, <m>\cos(\pi+\theta) =\cos(\pi-\theta)</m>
so that <m>r(\pi+\theta) = r(\pi-\theta)</m>. So we get the figure.
</p>

<sidebyside width="28%">
<image source="figs/cardiod4"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
<li><p>
Finally, we fill in a smooth curve through the dots and we get the
graph below. This curve is called a <em>cardioid</em> because it looks
like a heart<fn>Well, a mathematician's heart. The name <q>cardioid</q>
comes from the Greek word <m>\kappa \alpha \rho \delta \iota \alpha</m>
(which anglicizes to kardia) for heart.</fn>.

</ul>

<example xml:id="eg_rose"><title>The Three Petal Rose</title>
<p>
Now we'll use the same procedure as in the last example to sketch
the graph of
<me>
r=\sin(3\theta)
</me>
Again it will be useful to remember
what the graph of <m>\sin(3\theta)</m> looks like for <m>0\le\theta\le 2\pi</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="60%">
<image source="figs/sin3Graph"/>

<p>
<ul>
<li><p>
We'll first consider <m>0\le\theta\le\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, so that
<m>0\le 3\theta \le \pi</m>. On this interval <m>r(\theta)=\sin(3\theta)</m>
<ul>
<li>
          starts with <m>r(0)=0</m>, and then
</li>
<li>
          increases as <m>\theta</m> increases until
</li>
<li>
         <m>3\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, i.e. <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{6}</m>,
          where <m>r\big(\frac{\pi}{6}\big)=1</m>, and then
</li>
<li>
          decreases as <m>\theta</m> increases until

<li>
         <m>3\theta=\pi</m>, i.e. <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{3}</m>,
          where <m>r\big(\frac{\pi}{3}\big)=0</m>, again.
</li>
</ul>
Here is a table giving a few values of <m>r(\theta)</m> for
  <m>0\le \theta\le\frac{\pi}{3}</m>. Notice that we have chosen values of
<m>\theta</m> for which <m>\sin(3\theta)</m> is easy to compute.

Next consider <m>\frac{\pi}{3}\le\theta\le\frac{2\pi}{3}</m>, so that

We are now encountering, for the first time, <m>r(\theta)</m>'s that are negative.

<subsection xml:id="sec_polar_integrals"><title>Integrals in Polar Coordinates</title>


<p>We now return to the problem of using polar coordinates to set up
double integrals. So far, we have used Cartesian coordinates, in the sense
that we have cut up our domains of integration into tiny rectangles
(on which the integrand is essentially constant) by drawing in many lines of
constant <m>x</m> and many lines of constant <m>y</m>. To use polar coordinates,
we instead draw in both lines of constant <m>\theta</m> and curves of constant <m>r</m>.
This cuts the <m>xy</m>-plane up into approximate rectangles.
</p>

<sidebyside width="35%">
<image source="figs/polarRTh"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
Here is an enlarged sketch of one such approximate rectangle.
</p>

<sidebyside width="40%">
<image source="figs/polarA"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
One side has length <m>\dee{r}</m>, the spacing between the curves of constant <m>r</m>.
The other side is a portion of a circle of radius <m>r</m> that subtends,
at the origin, an angle <m>\dee{\theta}</m>, the angle between the lines
of constant <m>\theta</m>. As the circumference of the full circle is <m>2\pi r</m>
and as <m>\dee{\theta}</m> is the fraction <m>\frac{\dee{\theta}}{2\pi}</m>
of a full circle<fn>Recall that <m>\theta</m> has to be measured in radians for
this to be true.</fn>, the other side of the approximate rectangle has length
<m>\frac{\dee{\theta}}{2\pi}2\pi r = r\dee{\theta}</m>. So the shaded
region has area approximately
</p>

<fact xml:id="eq_dA_polar">
<statement>
<p>
<me>
\dee{A} = r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}
</me>
</p>
</statement>
</fact>
<p>
By way of comparison, using Cartesian coordinates we had <m>\dee{A}
=\dee{x}\,\dee{y}</m>.
</p>

<p>This intuitive computation has been somewhat handwavy<fn>
<q>Handwaving</q> is sometimes used as a pejorative to refer to
an argument that lacks substance. Here we are just using it to indicate
that we have left out a bunch of technical details.
In mathematics, <q>nose-following</q> is sometimes used as the polar opposite
of handwaving. It refers to a very narrow, mechanical, line of reasoning.</fn>.
But using it in
the usual integral setup procedure, in which we choose <m>\dee{r}</m> and
<m>\dee{\theta}</m> to be constants times <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> and then take the limit
<m>n\rightarrow 0</m>, gives, in the limit, error exactly zero. A sample argument,
in which we see the error going to zero in the limit <m>n\rightarrow\infty</m>,
is provided in the (optional) section §<xref ref="sec_integral_error"/>.

<p>Divide <m>\cR</m> into wedges (as in wedges of pie<fn>There is a pie/pi/pye
pun in there somewhere.</fn>
 or wedges of cheese)
by drawing in many lines of constant <m>\theta</m>, with the various
values of <m>\theta</m> differing by a tiny amount <m>\dee{\theta}</m>.
The figure on the right above shows one such wedge, outlined in blue.

<p>Concentrate on any one wedge. Subdivide the wedge further into
approximate rectangles by drawing in many circles of constant <m>r</m>,

The figure below shows one such approximate rectangle, in black.
</p>

<sidebyside width="50%">
<image source="figs/polarMass3"/>
</sidebyside>


<p>Now concentrate on one such rectangle. Let's say that it contains the point
with polar coordinates <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>. As we saw in <xref ref="eq_dA_polar"/> above,
<ul>
<li>
the area of that rectangle is essentially <m>\dee{A} =  r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}</m>.
</li>
<li>
As the mass density on the rectangle is essentially
           <m>f\big(r\cos\theta\,,\,r\sin\theta\big)</m>,
the mass of the rectangle is essentially
         <m>f\big(r\cos\theta\,,\,r\sin\theta\big)\,r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}</m>.
</li>
<li>
To get the mass of any one wedge,  say the wedge whose polar angle
runs from <m>\theta</m> to <m>\theta+\dee{\theta}</m>, we just add up the masses of the
approximate rectangles in that wedge, by integrating <m>r</m> from its
smallest value on the wedge, namely <m>B(\theta)</m>, to its largest value
on the wedge, namely <m>T(\theta)</m>. The mass of the wedge is thus
<me>
\dee{\theta} \int_{B(\theta)}^{T(\theta)}  \dee{r}\,r\,
       f\big(r\cos\theta\,,\,r\sin\theta\big)
</me>
</li>
<li>
Finally, to get the mass of <m>\cR</m>, we just add up the masses of all of the
different wedges, by integrating <m>\theta</m> from its smallest value on <m>\cR</m>,
namely <m>a</m>, to its largest value on <m>\cR</m>, namely <m>b</m>.
</li>
</ul>
In conclusion,
<me>

We have repeatedly used the word <q>essentially</q> above to avoid getting
into the nitty-gritty details required to prove things rigorously.
The mathematically correct proof of <xref ref="eq_polar_mass"/> follows
the same intuition, but requires some more careful error bounds,
as in the optional §<xref ref="sec_integral_error"/> below.
</p>
</solution>

</example>

<p>In the last example, we derived the important formula that the mass 
of the region
<me>
\cR=\Set{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)}{a\le\theta\le b,
               B(\theta)\le r\le T(\theta)}

</me>
</p>

<p>We can immediately adapt that example to calculate areas and derive the formula
that the area of the region
<me>
\cR=\Set{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)}{a\le\theta\le b, 
              0\le r\le R(\theta)}
</me>

</p>
<fact xml:id="eq_polar_area">

<me>
\text{Area}(\cR) =\frac{1}{2} \int_a^b R(\theta)^2\  \dee{\theta}

</fact>

<p> We just have set the density to <m>1</m>. We do so in the next example.

</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p> To get the area of <m>\cR</m> we just need to assign it a density
one and find the resulting mass. So, by <xref ref="eq_polar_mass"/>,

In this case we can easily do the inner <m>r</m> integral, giving
<me>
\text{Area}(\cR) =\frac{1}{2} \int_a^b R(\theta)^2\  \dee{\theta}
</me>
The expression <m>\frac{1}{2} R(\theta)^2\ \dee{\theta}</m> in
<xref ref="eq_polar_area"/> has a geometric interpretation. It is just
the area of a wedge of a circular disk of radius <m>R(\theta)</m>

angle <m>\dee{\theta}</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="40%">

<p>
To see this, note that area of the wedge
is the fraction <m>\frac{\dee{\theta}}{2\pi}</m>
of the area of the entire disk, which is <m>\pi R(\theta)^2</m>.
So <xref ref="eq_polar_area"/> just says that the area of <m>\cR</m> can be computed
by cutting <m>\cR</m> up into tiny wedges and adding up the areas of all of the
tiny wedges.

We follow our standard divide and sum up strategy. We will cut the
base region <m>\cR_1</m> into small pieces and sum up the volumes that
lie above each small piece.
<ul>
<li><p>
Divide <m>\cR_1</m> into wedges by drawing in many lines of constant

The figure on the right above shows one such approximate rectangle, in black.
</li>
<li><p>
Concentrate on one such rectangle. Let's say that it contains the point
with polar coordinates <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>. As we saw in <xref ref="eq_dA_polar"/> above,
<ul>
<li>
the area of that rectangle is essentially <m>\dee{A} =  r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}</m>.
</li>
<li><p>
The part of <m>\cV_1</m> that is above that rectangle is like an office
tower whose height is essentially
           <m>\sqrt{a^2-r^2}</m>,
and whose base has area <m>\dee{A} =  r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}</m>. It is
outlined in black in the figure below.
So the volume of the part of <m>\cV_1 </m> that is above the rectangle
is essentially
<m>\sqrt{a^2-r^2}\,r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}</m>.

To get the volume of the part of <m>\cV_1</m> above any one wedge (outlined
in blue in the figure below),  say the wedge whose polar angle runs
from <m>\theta</m> to <m>\theta+\dee{\theta}</m>,
we just add up the volumes above the approximate rectangles in that wedge,
by integrating <m>r</m> from its smallest value on the wedge, namely <m>0</m>,
to its largest value on the wedge, namely <m>b</m>. The volume above

Finally, to get the volume of <m>\cV_1</m>, we just add up the volumes
over all of the different wedges, by integrating <m>\theta</m> from its
smallest value on <m>\cR_1</m>, namely <m>0</m>, to its largest value on <m>\cR_1</m>,

</md>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Note that we can easily apply a couple of sanity checks to our answer.
<ul>
<li>
If the radius of the drill bit <m>b=0</m>, no metal is removed at all.
So the total volume removed should be zero. Our answer does indeed give
<m>0</m> in this case.
</li>
<li>
If the radius of the drill bit <m>b=a</m>, the radius of the sphere,
then the entire sphere disappears. So the total volume removed should
be the volume of a sphere of radius <m>a</m>. Our answer does indeed give
<m>\frac{4}{3}\pi a^3</m> in this case.
</li>
<li>  If the radius, <m>a</m>, of the sphere and the radius, <m>b</m>, of the drill bit
are measured in units of meters, then the remaining volume
<m>\frac{4\pi}{3}\left[a^3-{\big(a^2-b^2\big)}^{3/2}\right]</m>,
has units <m>\text{meters}^3</m>, as it should.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>The previous two problems were given to us (or nearly given to us)
in polar coordinates. We'll now get a little practice converting
integrals into polar coordinates, and recognising when it is helpful
to do so.
</p>


<example xml:id="eg_change_to_polar"><title>Changing to Polar Coordinates</title>
<statement>
<p>
Convert the integral <m>\int_0^1\int_0^x y\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\ \dee{y}\,\dee{x}</m>
to polar coordinates and evaluate the result.
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
First recall that in polar coordinates <m>x=r\cos\theta</m>, <m>y=r\sin\theta</m>
and <m>\dee{x}\,\dee{y}=\dee{A}=r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}</m> so that the
integrand (and <m>\dee{A}</m>)

<mrow>
y\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\ \dee{y}\,\dee{x}
=(r\sin\theta)\ r\ r\, \dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}
=r^3\sin\theta\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}
</mrow>
</md>
is very simple. So whether or not this integral will be easy to evaluate
using polar coordinates will be largely determined by the domain
of integration.
</p>

<p>So our main task is to sketch the domain of integration.
To prepare for the sketch, note that in the integral
<me>
\int_0^1\int_0^x y\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\ \dee{y}\,\dee{x}
=\int_0^1\dee{x}  \left[\int_0^x \dee{y}\ y\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right]
</me>
<ul>
<li>
the variable <m>x</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> and
</li>
<li>
for each fixed <m>0\le x\le 1</m>, <m>y</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>x</m>.
</li>
</ul>
So the domain of integration is
<me>
\cD=\Set{(x,y)}{0\le x\le 1,\ 0\le y\le x}
</me>
which is sketched in the figure on the left below.
It is a right angled triangle.
</p>

<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
<image source="figs/convPolarA"/>
<image source="figs/convPolarC"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
Next we express the domain of integration in terms of polar coordinates,
by expressing the equations of each of the boundary lines in terms of
polar coordinates.
<ul>
<li>
The <m>x</m>-axis, i.e. <m>y=r\sin\theta=0</m>, is <m>\theta=0</m>.
</li>
<li>
The line <m>x=1</m> is <m>r\cos\theta=1</m> or <m>r=\frac{1}{\cos\theta}</m>.
</li>
<li>
Finally, (in the first quadrant)  the line
<md>
<mrow>
y=x
\iff
r\sin\theta = r\cos\theta
\iff
\tan\theta=\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}=1
\iff
\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
</ul>
So, in polar coordinates, we can write the domain of integration as
<me>
\cR=\Big\{(r,\theta)\ \Big|\ 0\le\theta\le\frac{\pi}{4},\
             0\le r\le \frac{1}{\cos\theta}\Big\}
</me>
We can now slice up <m>\cR</m> using polar coordinates.
<ul>
<li><p>
Divide <m>\cR</m> into wedges by drawing in many lines of constant
<m>\theta</m>, with the various values of <m>\theta</m> differing by a tiny
amount <m>\dee{\theta}</m>. The figure on the right above shows one such wedge.
<ul>
<li>
The first wedge has <m>\theta=0</m>.
</li>
<li>
The last wedge has <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}</m>.
</li>
</ul></p>
</li>
<li><p>
Concentrate on any one wedge. Subdivide the wedge further into
approximate rectangles by drawing in many circles of constant <m>r</m>,
with the various values of <m>r</m> differing by a tiny amount <m>\dee{r}</m>.
The figure on the right above shows one such approximate rectangle, in black.
<ul>
<li>
The rectangle that contains the point with polar coordinates <m>r</m> and
<m>\theta</m> has area (essentially) <m>r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}</m>.
</li>
<li>
The first rectangle has <m>r=0</m>.
</li>
<li>
The last rectangle has <m>r=\frac{1}{\cos\theta}</m>.
</li>
</ul></p>

We'll now again compute the area of the region <m>\cR</m> that is
inside the circle <m>r=4\cos\theta</m> and to the left of the line <m>x=1</m>.
That was the region of interest in Example <xref ref="eg_area_polar"/>.
This time we'll just use some geometry. Think of <m>\cR</m> as being
the wedge <m>\cW</m>, of the figure on the left below, with the triangle
<m>\cT</m>, of the figure on the right below, removed.
</p>

<sidebyside>

</sidebyside>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
First we'll get the area of <m>\cW</m>. The cosine of the angle between the
<m>x</m> axis and the radius vector from <m>C</m> to <m>A</m> is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. So that
angle is <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m> and <m>\cW</m> subtends an angle of <m>\frac{2\pi}{3}</m>.
The entire circle has area <m>\pi 2^2</m>, so that <m>\cW</m>, which is the fraction
<m>\frac{2\pi/3}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{3}</m> of the full circle, has area
<m>\frac{4\pi}{3}</m>.
</li>
<li>
Now we'll get the area of the triangle <m>\cT</m>. Think of <m>\cT</m> as having
base <m>BD</m>. Then the length of the base of <m>\cT</m> is <m>2\sqrt{3}</m>
and the height of <m>\cT</m> is <m>1</m>. So <m>\cT</m> has area <m>\frac{1}{2}(2\sqrt{3})(1)
=\sqrt{3}</m>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>We used some hand waving in deriving the area formula <xref ref="eq_polar_area"/>:
the word <q>essentially</q> appeared quite a few times. Here is
how do that derivation more rigorously.
</p>

</subsection>


<subsection xml:id="sec_integral_error">
  <title>Optional<mdash/> Error Control for the Polar Area Formula></title>

<p>Let <m>0\le a \lt b\le 2\pi</m>. In Examples <xref ref="eg_polar_mass"/>
and <xref ref="eg_polar_area"/> we derived the formula
<me>
A=\frac{1}{2}\int_a^b R(\theta)^2\,d\theta
</me>
for the area of the region
<me>
\cR=\Set{\big(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta\big)}
     {a\le\theta\le b,\ 0\le r\le R(\theta)}
</me>
In the course of that derivation we approximated the area of the
shaded region in
</p>

<sidebyside width="40%">
<image source="figs/polarA"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
by <m>\dee{A} = r\,\dee{r}\,\dee{\theta}</m>.
</p>

<p>We will now justify that approximation, under the assumption that
<me>
0\le R(\theta)\le M \qquad |R'(\theta)|\le L
</me>
for all <m>a\le \theta\le b</m>. That is, <m>R(\theta)</m> is bounded and
its derivative exists and is bounded too.
</p>

<p> Divide the interval <m>a\le \theta\le b</m> into <m>n</m> equal subintervals,
each of length <m>\De\theta=\frac{b-a}{n}</m>. Let <m>\theta_i^*</m> be the midpoint of
the <m>i^{\rm th}</m> interval. On the <m>i^{\rm th}</m> interval, <m>\theta</m> runs from
<m>\theta_i^*-\frac{1}{2}\De\theta</m> to <m>\theta_i^*+\frac{1}{2}\De\theta</m>.
</p>

<p>By the mean value theorem
<md>
<mrow>
R(\theta)-R(\theta_i^*)  = R'(c) (\theta-\theta_i^*)
</mrow>
</md>
for some <m>c</m> between <m>\theta</m> and <m>\theta_i^*</m>. Because <m>|R'(\theta)|\le L</m>
<me>
\big|R(\theta)-R(\theta_i^*)\big|  \le L \big|\theta-\theta_i^*\big|
\tag{$*$}
</me>
This tells us that the difference between <m>R(\theta)</m> and <m>R(\theta_i^*)</m>
can't be too big compared to <m>\big|\theta-\theta_i^*\big|</m>.
</p>

<p>On the <m>i^{\rm th}</m> interval, the radius <m>r=R(\theta)</m> runs over all
values of <m>R(\theta)</m> with <m>\theta</m> satisfying <m>\big|\theta-\theta_i^*\big|\le\frac{1}{2}\De\theta</m>.
By <m>(*)</m>, all of these values of <m>R(\theta)</m> lie between
<m>r_i=R(\theta_i^*)-\frac{1}{2} L\De\theta</m> and
<m>R_i=R(\theta_i^*) +\frac{1}{2} L\De\theta</m>.
Consequently the part of <m>\cR</m> having <m>\theta</m> in the <m>i^{\rm th}</m>
subinterval, namely,
<me>
\cR_i=\Set{\big(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta\big)}
     {\theta_i^*-\half\De\theta\le\theta\le \theta_i^*+\half\De\theta,
           \ 0\le r\le R(\theta)}
</me>
must contain all of the circular sector
<me>
\Set{\big(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta\big)}
     {\theta_i^*-\half\De\theta\le\theta\le \theta_i^*+\half\De\theta,
           \ 0\le r\le r_i}
</me>
and must be completely contained inside the circular sector
<me>
\Set{\big(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta\big)}
     {\theta_i^*-\half\De\theta\le\theta\le \theta_i^*+\half\De\theta,
           \ 0\le r\le R_i}
</me>
</p>

<p>
That is, we have found one circular sector that is bigger than the one
we are approximating, and one circular sector that is smaller.
The area of a circular disk of radius <m>\rho</m> is <m>\pi\rho^2</m>.
A circular sector of radius <m>\rho</m>  that subtends an angle <m>\De \theta</m>
is the fraction <m>\frac{\De\theta}{2\pi}</m> of the full disk and so has
the area <m>\frac{\De\theta}{2\pi}\pi\rho^2 = \frac{\De\theta}{2}\rho^2</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="33%">

=R(\theta_i^*)^2 \pm L R(\theta_i^*)\De\theta +\frac{1}{4} L^2\De\theta^2

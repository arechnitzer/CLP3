\begin{question}
For each of the following, evaluate the given double integral 
\emph{without} using iteration. Instead, interpret the integral as, for
example, an area or a volume.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
$\dst\int_{-1}^3\int_{-4}^1 \dee{y}\,\dee{x}$
\item
$\dst\int_0^2\int_0^{\sqrt{4-y^2}} \dee{x}\,\dee{y}$
\item
$\dst\int_{-3}^3\int_0^{\sqrt{9-y^2}}\sqrt{9-x^2-y^2}\ \dee{x}\,\dee{y}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
(a) $20$\qquad
(b) $\pi$  \qquad
(c) $9\pi$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
(a) The given double integral
$\int_{-1}^3\int_{-4}^1 \dee{y}\,\dee{x}=\dblInt_R \dee{x}\,\dee{y}$ 
where
\begin{equation*}
R=\Set{(x,y)}{ -1\le x\le 3,\ -4\le y\le1}
\end{equation*}
and so the integral is the area of a rectangle with sides of lengths 
$4$ and $5$.  Thus $\int_{-1}^3\int_{-4}^1 \dee{y}\,\dee{x}=4\times 5=20$.

(b) The given double integral
$\dst\int_0^2\int_0^{\sqrt{4-y^2}} \dee{x}\,\dee{y}
     =\dst\dblInt_R \dee{x}\,\dee{y}$ 
where
\begin{align*}
R&=\Set{(x,y)}{ 0\le y\le 2,\ 0\le x\le\sqrt{4-y^2}} \\
&=\Set{(x,y)}{ x\ge 0,\ y\ge 0,\ y\le 2,\ x^2+y^2\le 4} 
\end{align*}
So $R$ is the first quadrant part of the circular disk of radius $2$
centred on $(0,0)$. The area of the full disk is $\pi\,2^2=4\pi$. 
The given integral is one quarter of that, which is $\pi$.

(c) The given double integral
$\dst\int_{-3}^3\int_0^{\sqrt{9-y^2}}\sqrt{9-x^2-y^2}\ \dee{x}\,\dee{y}
     =\dst\dblInt_{\cR} z(x,y)\ \dee{x}\,\dee{y}$ 
where $z(x,y)=\sqrt{9-x^2-y^2}$ and
\begin{align*}
\cR&=\Set{(x,y)}{ -3\le y\le 3,\ 0\le x\le\sqrt{9-y^2}} \\
&=\Set{(x,y)}{ x\ge 0,\ -3\le y\le 3,\ \ x^2+y^2\le 9} 
\end{align*}
So $\cR$ is the right half of the circular disk of radius $3$
centred on $(0,0)$. By Equation (\eref{CLP200}{eqn Volume y slice}) 
in the CLP-3 text, the given integral is the volume of the solid
\begin{align*}
\cV&=\Big\{\,(x,y,z)\,\Big|\,(x,y)\in\cR,\ 0\le z\le \sqrt{9-x^2-y^2}\,\Big\}\\
&=\Big\{\,(x,y,z)\,\Big|\,(x,y)\in\cR,\ z\ge 0,\ x^2+y^2+z^2\le 9\,\Big\}
\end{align*}
Thus $\cV$ is the one quarter of the spherical ball of radius $3$ and 
centre $(0,0,0)$ with $x\ge 0$ and $z\ge 0$. So
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-3}^3\int_0^{\sqrt{9-y^2}}\sqrt{9-x^2-y^2}\ \dee{x}\,\dee{y}
=\frac{1}{4}\Big(\frac{4}{3}\pi 3^3\Big)
=9\pi
\end{equation*} 




\end{solution}

\begin{question}
Let $f(x,y)= 12 x^2y^3$. Evaluate
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
$\dst\int_0^3 f(x,y)\,\dee{x}$
\item
$\dst\int_0^2 f(x,y)\,\dee{y}$
\item
$\dst\int_0^2\int_0^3 f(x,y)\,\dee{x}\,\dee{y}$
\item
$\dst\int_0^3\int_0^2 f(x,y)\,\dee{y}\,\dee{x}$
\item
$\dst\int_0^3\int_0^2 f(x,y)\,\dee{x}\,\dee{y}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{hint}
Be careful to match each integration variable with its own limits.
Remember that the integral with respect to $x$ treats $y$ as a constant and 
the integral with respect to $y$ treats $x$ as a constant.
\end{hint}

\begin{answer}
(a) $108 y^3$\qquad
(b) $48x^2$\qquad
(c), (d) $432$\qquad
(e) $648$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
(a) The integral with respect to $x$ treats $y$ as a constant. So
\begin{align*}
\int_0^3 f(x,y)\,\dee{x}
  &= \int_0^3 12 x^2y^3\,\dee{x}
   = \Big[4x^3y^3\Big]_{x=0}^{x=3}
   = 108 y^3
\end{align*}

(b) The integral with respect to $y$ treats $x$ as a constant. So
\begin{align*}
\int_0^2 f(x,y)\,\dee{y}
  &= \int_0^2 12 x^2y^3\,\dee{y}
   = \Big[3x^2y^4\Big]_{y=0}^{y=2}
   = 48x^2
\end{align*}

(c) By part (a)
\begin{align*}
\int_0^2\int_0^3 f(x,y)\,\dee{x}\,\dee{y}
&=\int_0^2\left[\int_0^3 f(x,y)\,\dee{x}\right]\dee{y}
 =\int_0^2 108y^3\,\dee{y}
 =\Big[27y^4\Big]_{y=0}^{y=2} \\
&=27\times 16 
= 432
\end{align*}

(d) By part (b)
\begin{align*}
\int_0^3\int_0^2 f(x,y)\,\dee{y}\,\dee{x}
&=\int_0^3\left[\int_0^2 f(x,y)\,\dee{y}\right]\dee{x}
 =\int_0^3 48x^2\,\dee{y}
 =\Big[16x^3\Big]_{x=0}^{x=3} \\
&=16\times 27 
= 432
\end{align*}

(e) This time
\begin{align*}
\int_0^3\int_0^2 f(x,y)\,\dee{x}\,\dee{y}
&=\int_0^3\left[\int_0^2 12 x^2y^3\,\dee{x}\right]\dee{y}
=\int_0^3\left[4 x^3y^3\right]_0^2\dee{y}
=\int_0^3 32 y^3\dee{y} \\
& =\Big[8y^4\Big]_0^3 
 =8\times 81
 = 648
\end{align*}

into a single iterated double integral with the order of

%\begin{hint}
%
%\end{hint}

\begin{answer}
$\int_{x=0}^{x=1}\int_{y=x}^{y=2-x} f(x,y)\ \dee{y}\,\dee{x}$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
In the given integrals
\begin{itemize}
\item
$y$ runs for $0$ to $2$, and

\item
for each fixed $y$ between $0$ and $1$, $x$ runs from $0$ to $y$
and


\item
for each fixed $y$ between $1$ and $2$, $x$ runs from $0$ to $2-y$
\end{itemize}
The figure on the left below contains a sketch of that region together
with the generic horizontal slices that were used to set up the given
integrals.
\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE06A_6h.pdf}\qquad
     \includegraphics{OE06A_6v.pdf}
\end{center}
To reverse the order of integration, we switch to vertical, rather
than horizontal, slices, as in the figure on the right above.
Looking at that figure, we see that 
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs for $0$ to $1$, and

\item
for each fixed $x$ in that range, $y$ runs from $x$ to $2-x$.
\end{itemize}
So the desired integral is
\begin{align*}
\int_{x=0}^{x=1}\int_{y=x}^{y=2-x} f(x,y)\ \dee{y}\,\dee{x}

(b) $\half(e-1)$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
(a) In the given integral
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  $x$ runs from $0$ to $1$ and
\item
  for each fixed $x$ between $0$ and $1$, $y$ runs from $x$ to $1$ 
\end{itemize}
So the domain of integration is 
\begin{equation*}
D = \Set{(x,y)}{0\le x\le 1,\ x\le y\le 1}
\end{equation*}
It is sketched in the figure on the left below.

\begin{center}

(b) The given integral decomposed the domain of integration into 
vertical strips like the blue strip in the figure on the right above. 
To reverse the order of integration, we instead use horizontal strips. 
Looking at the pink strip in the figure on the right above, we see that 
this entails
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  having $y$ run from $0$ to $1$ and
\item
  for each fixed $y$ between $0$ and $1$, having $x$ run from $0$ to $y$ 
\end{itemize}
This gives
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1\dee{y}\int_0^y \dee{x}\ e^{x/y}=\int_0^1\dee{y}\ \Big[ye^{x/y}\Big]_0^y

\begin{answer}
(a) The region $R$ is the shaded region in the figure

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE06D_4.pdf}
\end{center}

(b) $I= \int_{1/\sqrt{2}}^1 \int_{1/x}^{2x} f(x,y)\,\dee{y}\,\dee{x}
    +\int_1^2 \int_{x^2}^{2x} f(x,y)\,\dee{y}\,\dee{x}$ \qquad
(c) $\frac{1}{2}$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
(a) On $R$
\begin{itemize}
\item
$y$ runs from $1$ to $4$ (from $1$ to $\sqrt{2}$ in the first integral and
from $\sqrt{2}$ to $4$ in the second).
\item 
For each fixed $y$ between $1$ and $\sqrt{2}$, $x$ runs from $\frac{1}{y}$
to $\sqrt{y}$ and 
\item 
for each fixed $y$ between $\sqrt{2}$ and $4$, $x$ runs from $\frac{y}{2}$
to $\sqrt{y}$.
\end{itemize}
The figure on the left below is a sketch of $R$, together with 
generic horizontal strips as were used in setting up the integral.

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE06D_4h.pdf}\qquad
     \includegraphics{OE06D_4v.pdf}
\end{center}

(b) To reverse the order of integration we use vertical strips as in
the figure on the right above. Looking at that figure, we see that, on $R$,
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $1/\sqrt{2}$ to $2$.
\item 
For each fixed $x$ between $1/\sqrt{2}$ and $1$, $y$ runs from $\frac{1}{x}$
to $2x$ and 
\item 
for each fixed $x$ between $1$ and $2$, $y$ runs from $x^2$
to $2x$.
\end{itemize}
So
\begin{align*}
I= \int_{1/\sqrt{2}}^1 \int_{1/x}^{2x} f(x,y)\,\dee{y}\,\dee{x}
    +\int_1^2 \int_{x^2}^{2x} f(x,y)\,\dee{y}\,\dee{x}
\end{align*}

(c) When $f(x,y)=\frac{x}{y}$,
\begin{align*}
I &= \int_1^{\sqrt{2}} \int_{1/y}^{\sqrt{y}} \frac{x}{y}\,\dee{x}\,\dee{y}
    +\int_{\sqrt{2}}^4 \int_{y/2}^{\sqrt{y}} \frac{x}{y}\,\dee{x}\,\dee{y} \\
  &=\int_1^{\sqrt{2}} \frac{1}{y}\left[\frac{y}{2}-\frac{1}{2y^2}\right]
                                               \,\dee{y}
    +\int_{\sqrt{2}}^4 \frac{1}{y}\left[\frac{y}{2}-\frac{y^2}{8}\right]
                                               \,\dee{y} \\
  &=\left[\frac{y}{2}+\frac{1}{4y^2}\right]_1^{\sqrt{2}}
    +\left[\frac{y}{2}-\frac{y^2}{16}\right]_{\sqrt{2}}^4 
   =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} +\frac{1}{8}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}
     +2 -1 -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} +\frac{1}{8} \\
  &=\frac{1}{2}

(a) When $f(x,y)=x$,
\begin{align*}
\int_{x=-1}^{x=3}\left[\int_{y=x^2}^{y=2x+3} x \dee{y}\right] \dee{x}
&= \int_{x=-1}^{x=3}\left[x(2x+3-x^2) \right] \dee{x} \\

(b) On the region $E$
\begin{itemize}
\item
 $x$ runs from $-1$ to $3$ and

(c) To reverse the order of integration we use horizontal strips

on the region $E$,
\begin{itemize}
\item
 $y$ runs from $0$ to $9$ and

Let $I$ be the double integral of the function $f(x,y) = y^2 \sin xy$ 
over the triangle with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 1)$ 
in the $xy$--plane.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Write $I$ as an iterated integral in two different ways.

\item 
Evaluate $I$.

\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

%
%\end{hint}

\begin{answer}
(a) $I=\int_0^1\dee{x}\int_x^1\dee{y}\ y^2\sin xy  
           =\int_0^1\dee{y}\int_0^y\dee{x}\ y^2\sin xy$

(b) $\frac{1-\sin 1}{2}$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
(a) Let's call the triangle $\cT$.
Here are two sketches of $\cT$, one including a generic vertical strip
and one including a generic horizontal strip. Notice that the equation
of the line through $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ is $y=x$.

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE09A_5v.pdf}\qquad
     \includegraphics{OE09A_5h.pdf}\qquad
\end{center}

First, we'll set up the integral using vertical strips. Looking
at the figure on the left above, we see that, on $\cT$,
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $0$ to $1$ and
\item
for each $x$ in that range, $y$ runs from $x$ to $1$.
\end{itemize}
So the integral
\begin{align*}
I=\int_0^1\dee{x}\int_x^1\dee{y}\ y^2\sin xy
\end{align*}

Next, we'll set up the integral using horizontal strips. Looking
at the figure on the right above, we see that, on $\cT$,
\begin{itemize}
\item
$y$ runs from $0$ to $1$ and
\item
for each $y$ in that range, $x$ runs from $0$ to $y$.
\end{itemize}
So the integral
\begin{align*}
I=\int_0^1\dee{y}\int_0^y\dee{x}\ y^2\sin xy
\end{align*}

(b) To evaluate the inside integral,  $\int_x^1\dee{y}\ y^2\sin xy$,
of the vertical strip version, will require two integration by
parts to get rid of the $y^2$. So we'll use the horizontal strip version.
\begin{align*}
I&=\int_0^1\dee{y}\int_0^y\dee{x}\ y^2\sin xy \\
&=\int_0^1\dee{y}\ \Big[-y\cos xy\Big]_0^y \\
&=\int_0^1\dee{y}\ \big[y-y\cos y^2\big] \\
&=\left[\frac{y^2}{2}-\frac{\sin y^2}{2}\right]_0^1
\qquad\text{(Look's pretty rigged!)} \\
&= \frac{1-\sin 1}{2}
\end{align*}

\end{solution}

\begin{question}[M200 2009D] %5
Find the volume $(V)$ of the solid bounded above by the surface
\begin{equation*}
z = f (x,y) = e^{-x^2},
\end{equation*}
below by the plane $z = 0$ and over the triangle in the $xy$--plane
formed by the lines $x = 1$, $y = 0$ and $y = x$.

\end{question}

%\begin{hint}
%
%\end{hint}

\begin{answer}
$\frac{1-e^{-1}}{2}$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
If we call the triangular base region $\cT$, then the volume is
\begin{align*}
V=\dblInt_\cT f(x,y)\ \dee{A} = \dblInt_\cT e^{-x^2}\ \dee{x}\,\dee{y}
\end{align*}
If we set up the integral using horizontal slices, so that the inside integral
is the $x$--integral, there will be a big problem --- the integrand 
$e^{-x^2}$ does not have an obvious anti--derivative. (In fact its
antiderivative cannot be expressed in terms of familiar functions.)
So let's try vertical slices as in the sketch 
\begin{center}
      \includegraphics{OE09D_5.pdf}
\end{center}
Looking at that sketch we see that
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $0$ to $1$, and 
\item
for each $x$ in that range, $y$ runs from $0$ to $x$.
\end{itemize}
So the integral is
\begin{align*}
V&=\int_0^1\dee{x}\int_0^x\dee{y}\ e^{-x^2} \\
&=\int_0^1 \dee{x}\ xe^{-x^2} \\
&=\left[-\frac{1}{2}e^{-x^2}\right]_0^1 \\
&=\frac{1-e^{-1}}{2}

\begin{solution}
(a) On the domain of integration
\begin{itemize}
\item
$y$ runs from $0$ to $1$ and
\item
for each $y$ in that range $x$ runs from $y$ to $2-y$.
So the left hand side of the domain is the line $x=y$ and 
the right hand side of the domain is $x=2-y$.
\end{itemize}
The figure on the left below is a sketch of that domain, together with 
a generic horizontal strip as was used in setting up the integral.

\begin{center}

     \includegraphics{OE09D_6v.pdf}\qquad

(b) 
To reverse the order of integration we use vertical, rather than horizontal, strips. Looking at the figure on the right above, we see that, in the
domain of integration
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $0$ to $2$ and
\item
for each $x$ between $0$ and $1$, $y$ runs from $0$ to $x$, while
\item
for each $x$ between $1$ and $2$, $y$ runs from $0$ to $2-x$.

So the integral
\begin{align*}
I=\int_0^1\dee{x}\int_0^x\dee{y}\ \frac{y}{x}
  +\int_1^2\dee{x}\int_0^{2-x}\dee{y}\ \frac{y}{x} 
\end{align*}

(c) Using the answer to part (b)
\begin{align*}
I&=\int_0^1\dee{x}\int_0^x\dee{y}\ \frac{y}{x}
  +\int_1^2\dee{x}\int_0^{2-x}\dee{y}\ \frac{y}{x} \\
&=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^1\dee{x}\ x
    +\frac{1}{2}\int_1^2\dee{x}\ \frac{(2-x)^2}{x}\\
&=\frac{1}{4} +\frac{1}{2}\int_1^2\dee{x}\ \left(\frac{4}{x}-4+x\right) \\
&=\frac{1}{4} +\frac{1}{2}\left[4\ln 2 -4 + \frac{4-1}{2}\right] \\
&=2\ln 2 -1

(b) $\frac{2\big(2\sqrt{2}-1\big)}{9}$

\begin{solution}
(a)
On the domain of integration,
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $0$ to $1$, and
\item
for each fixed $x$ in that range,
$y$ runs from $\sqrt{x}$ to $1$.
We may rewrite $y=\sqrt{x}$ as $x=y^2$, which is a rightward opening
parabola.
\end{itemize}
Here are two sketches of the domain of integration, which we call $D$.
The left hand sketch also shows a vertical slice, as was used in setting up 
the integral.
\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE10A_6v.pdf}\qquad

(b) The inside integral, $\int_{\sqrt{x}}^1 \sqrt{1+y^3}\ \dee{y}$,
of the given integral looks pretty nasty. So let's reverse the order of 
integration, by using horizontal, rather than vertical, slices.
Looking at the figure on the right above, we see that

\item
$y$ runs from $0$ to $1$, and
\item
for each fixed $y$ in that range
$x$ runs from $0$ to $y^2$.

So
\begin{align*}
I &= \int_0^1\dee{y} \int_0^{y^2}\dee{x}\ \sqrt{1+y^3} \\
&=\int_0^1\dee{y} \ y^2\sqrt{1+y^3} \\

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics[scale=0.95]{OE10D_5b.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
(a) Observe that the parabola $y^2=x$ and the line $y=x-2$ meet
when $x=y+2$ and
\begin{equation*}
y^2=y+2
\iff y^2-y-2=0
\iff (y-2)(y+1)=0
\end{equation*}
So the points of intersection of $x=y^2$ and $y=x-2$ are $(1,-1)$
and $(4,2)$. Here is a sketch of $D$.

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE10D_5aa.pdf}
\end{center}

To evaluate $J$, we'll use horizontal slices as in the figure above.
(If we were to use vertical slices we would have to split the integral in two,
with $0\le x\le 1$ in one part and $1\le x\le 4$ in the other.)
From the figure, we see that, on $D$,
\begin{itemize}
\item
$y$ runs from $-1$ to $2$ and
\item 
for each fixed $y$ in that range, $x$ runs from $y^2$ to $y+2$.
\end{itemize}
Hence
\begin{align*}
J &=\dblInt_D 3y\ \dee{A}
  =\int_{-1}^2\dee{y}\int_{y^2}^{y+2}\dee{x}\ 3y \\
  &=3\int_{-1}^2\dee{y}\ y(y+2-y^2) \\
  &=3\left[\frac{y^3}{3}+y^2-\frac{y^4}{4}\right]_{-1}^2 \\
  &=3\left[\frac{8}{3}+4-4+\frac{1}{3}-1+\frac{1}{4}\right] \\
  &=\frac{27}{4}
\end{align*}

(b) 
On the domain of integration,
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $0$ to $4$ and
\item 
for each fixed $x$ in that range, $y$ runs from $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{x}$ to $1$.
\end{itemize}
The figure on the left below is a sketch of that domain, together with 
a generic vertical strip as was used in setting up the integral.

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE10D_5bv.pdf}\qquad
     \includegraphics{OE10D_5bh.pdf}\qquad
\end{center}

The inside integral, over $y$, looks pretty nasty because $e^{y^3}$
does not have an obvious antiderivative. So let's reverse the order
of integration. That is, let's use horizontal, rather than vertical,
strips. From the figure on the right above, we see that, on the
domain of integration
\begin{itemize}
\item
$y$ runs from $0$ to $1$ and
\item 
for each fixed $y$ in that range, $x$ runs from $0$ to $4y^2$.
\end{itemize}
So 
\begin{align*}
I &= \int_0^1\dee{y}\int_0^{4y^2}\dee{x}\ e^{y^3} \\
  &= \int_0^1\dee{y}\ 4y^2 e^{y^3} \\
  &= \frac{4}{3}\int_0^1\dee{u}\ e^u \qquad\text{with }
                 u=y^3,\ \dee{u}=3y^2\,\dee{y}\qquad

\begin{solution}
On the domain of integration 
\begin{itemize}
\item
$y$ runs from $0$ to $4$. In inequalities, $0\le y\le 4$.
\item
For each fixed $y$ in that range, $x$ runs from $\sqrt{y}$ to
$\sqrt{8-y}$. In inequalities, that is $\sqrt{y}\le x\le \sqrt{8-y}$,
or $y\le x^2\le 8-y$.

Here are two sketchs of the domain of integration.

(b) To reverse the order we observe, from the figure on the right above,
that, on the domain of integration,
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $0$ to $\sqrt{8}$. In inequalities, $0\le x\le \sqrt{8}$.
\item
For each fixed $x$ between $0$ and $2$, $y$ runs from $0$ to

For each fixed $x$ between $2$ and $\sqrt{8}$, $y$ runs from $0$ to
$8-x^2$. In inequalities, that is $0\le y\le 8-x^2$.

$\frac{1}{4}\big[e^4-1\big]$

\begin{solution}
The antiderivative of the function $e^{-y^2}$ cannot be expressed
in terms of elementary functions. So the inside integral 
$\int_{-2}^{2x} e^{y^2}\ \dee{y}$ cannot be evaluated using 
standard calculus 2 techniques. The trick for dealing with this
integral is to reverse the order of integration.
On the domain of integration 
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $-1$ to $0$. In inequalities, $-1\le x\le 0$.
\item
For each fixed $x$ in that range, $y$ runs from $-2$ to
$2x$. In inequalities,  $-2\le y\le 2x$.
\end{itemize}
The domain of integration, namely
\begin{equation*}
\Set{(x,y)}{-1\le x\le 0,\ -2\le y\le 2x}

is sketched in the figure on the left below.

\begin{center}

express the domain of integration as

\begin{answer}
 $I = \int_0^2 \int_y^{6-y^2} f(x,y)\ \dee{x}\,\dee{y}$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
We first have to get a picture of the domain of integration.
The first integral has domain of integration
\begin{equation*}
\Set{(x,y)}{0\le x\le 2,\ 0\le y\le x}
\end{equation*} 
and the second integral has domain of integration
\begin{equation*}
\Set{(x,y)}{2\le x\le 6,\ 0\le y\le \sqrt{6-x}}
\end{equation*} 
Here is a sketch. The domain of integration for the first integral
is the shaded triangular region to the left of $x=2$ and the domain
of integration for the second integral is the shaded region to the right
of $x=2$.

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE14A_6.pdf}

To exchange the order of integration, we use horizontal slices as in the
figure below.

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE14A_6h.pdf}
\end{center}

The bottom slice has $y=0$ and the top slice has $y=2$.
On the slice at height $y$, $x$ runs from $y$ to $6-y^2$. So

I = \int_0^2 \int_y^{6-y^2} f(x,y)\ \dee{x}\,\dee{y}

(b) As it stands, the inside integral, over $y$, looks pretty nasty
because $\sin(y^3)$ does not have an obvious antiderivative. So let's
reverse the order of integration. The given integral was set up

(b)
$27+18\ln\frac{3}{2}\approx 34.30$

\begin{solution}
(a) The solid is the set of all $(x,y,z)$ obeying
$0\le x\le 3$, $0\le y\le 3$ and $0\le z\le 6-xy$. The base of this region
is the set of all $(x,y)$ for which there is a $z$ such that $(x,y,z)$
is in the solid. So the base is the set of all $(x,y)$ obeying
$0\le x\le 3$, $0\le y\le 3$ and $6-xy\ge 0$, i.e. $xy\le 6$. 
This region is sketched in the figure on the left below.

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE03DQ6a.pdf} \qquad
     \includegraphics{OE03DQ6.pdf} 
\end{center}

(b) We'll deompose the base region into vertical strips as in the
figure on the right above.
Observe that the line $y=3$ intersects the curve $xy=6$ at the point $(2,3)$
and that on the base
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $0$ to $3$ and that
\item
for each fixed $x$ between $0$ and $2$, $y$ runs from $0$ to $3$, while
\item
for each fixed $x$ between $2$ and $3$, $y$ runs from $0$ to $6/x$
\end{itemize}
and that, for each $(x,y)$ in the base, $z$ runs from $0$ to $6-xy$.
So the

\text{Volume}&=\int_0^2\dee{x}\int_0^3\dee{y}\ (6-xy)+

\item 
$x$ runs from $-2$ to $2$ and

The inside integral, $\int_{x^2}^4\cos\big(y^{3/2}\big)\ \dee{y}$,
in the given integral looks really nasty.  So let's try exchanging
the order of integration. The given integral was formed by decomposing
the domain of integration $D$ into horizontal strips, like the blue strip
in the figure above. To exchange the order of integration we instead
decompose the domain of integration $D$ into vertical strips, 
like the pink strip in the figure above. To do so, we observe that, on $D$,

$y$ runs from $0$ to $4$ and

for each fixed $y$ between $0$ and $4$, $x$ runs from $-\sqrt{y}$ to $\sqrt{y}$.

%\begin{hint}

\begin{answer}
(a) $\dst I=\dblInt_D (8+2xy)\ \dee{x}\dee{y}$ where 
    $D=\Set{(x,y)}{x^2+(y-1)^2\le 1}$

(b) $\dst I
  =\int_0^2 \dee{y}\int_{-\sqrt{2y-y^2}}^{\sqrt{2y-y^2}}\dee{x}\ (8+2xy) 
  =\int_{-1}^1 \dee{x}\int_{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}\dee{y}\ (8+2xy)$

(c) $8\pi$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
(a) We may rewrite the equation $x^2+y^2=2y$ of the cylinder as
$x^2+(y-1)^2=1$. We are (in part (c)) to find the volume of the set
\begin{equation*}
V=\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+(y-1)^2\le 1,\ 0\le z\le 8+2xy}
\end{equation*}
When we look at this solid from far above (so that we can't see $z$) 
we see the set of points $(x,y)$ that 
obey $x^2+(y-1)^2\le 1$ and $8+2xy\ge 0$ (so that there is at least one allowed $z$ for that $(x,y)$). All points in $x^2+(y-1)^2\le 1$
have $-1\le x\le 1$ and $0\le y\le 2$ and hence $-2\le xy\le 2$ and
$8+2xy\ge 0$. So the domain of integration consists of the full disk
\begin{equation*}
D = \Set{(x,y)}{x^2+(y-1)^2\le 1}
\end{equation*}
The volume is 
\begin{equation*}
I=\dblInt_D (8+2xy)\ \dee{x}\dee{y}
\end{equation*}

(b)
We can express the double integral over $D$ as iterated integrals by
decomposing $D$ into horizontal strips, like the pink strip in the 
figure below, and also by decomposing $D$ into blue strips, like the 
blue strip in the figure below.
\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE02AQ7.pdf} 
\end{center}
For horizontal strips, we use that, on $D$
\begin{itemize}
\item
$y$ runs from $0$ to $2$ and,
\item
for each fixed $y$ between $0$ and $2$, $x$ runs from $-\sqrt{2y-y^2}$
to $\sqrt{2y-y^2}$ 
\end{itemize}
so that
\begin{equation*}
D=\Set{(x,y)}{0\le y\le 2,\ -\sqrt{2y-y^2}\le x\le \sqrt{2y-y^2}}
\end{equation*}
For vertical strips, we use that, on $D$
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $-1$ to $1$ and,
\item
for each fixed $x$ between $-1$ and $1$, $y$ runs from $1-\sqrt{1-x^2}$
to $1+\sqrt{1-x^2}$ 
\end{itemize}
so that
\begin{equation*}
D=\Set{(x,y)}{-1\le x\le 1,\ 1-\sqrt{1-x^2}\le x\le 1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}
\end{equation*}
Thus
\begin{align*}
I&=\int_0^2 \dee{y}\int_{-\sqrt{2y-y^2}}^{\sqrt{2y-y^2}}\dee{x}\ (8+2xy) \\
 &=\int_{-1}^1 \dee{x}\int_{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}\dee{y}\ (8+2xy)
\end{align*}

(c) Since $\dblInt_D 8\ \dee{x}\dee{y}$ is just $8$ times the area of $D$,
which is $\pi$,
\begin{align*}
\text{Volume}&=8\pi+\int_0^2 \dee{y}\int_{-\sqrt{2y-y^2}}^{\sqrt{2y-y^2}}\dee{x}\ 2xy
=8\pi+2\int_0^2 \dee{y}\ y\int_{-\sqrt{2y-y^2}}^{\sqrt{2y-y^2}}\dee{x}\ x \\
&=8\pi
\end{align*}
because $\int_{-\sqrt{2y-y^2}}^{\sqrt{2y-y^2}}\dee{x}\ x=0$ for all $y$,
because the integrand is odd and the domain of integration is even.

\begin{equation*}
\int_0^9\int_{\sqrt{y}}^3\sin(\pi x^3)\ \dee{x}\dee{y}
\end{equation*}
\end{question}

\begin{hint}
The inside integral, $\dst\int_{\sqrt{y}}^3\sin\big(\pi x^3\big)\ \dee{x}$,
in the given integral looks really nasty.  So try exchanging
the order of integration.
\end{hint}

\begin{answer}
$\frac{2}{3\pi}\approx 0.212$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
In the given integral
\begin{itemize}
\item 
$y$ runs from $0$ to $9$ and
\item
for each fixed $y$ between $0$ and $9$, $x$ runs from $\sqrt{y}$ to $3$
\end{itemize}
So the domain of integration is 
\begin{equation*}
D = \Set{(x,y)}{0\le y\le 9,\  \sqrt{y}\le x\le 3}
\end{equation*}
This is sketched below.

The inside integral, $\int_{\sqrt{y}}^3\sin\big(\pi x^3\big)\ \dee{x}$,
in the given integral looks really nasty.  So let's try exchanging
the order of integration. The given integral was formed by decomposing
the domain of integration $D$ into horizontal strips, like the blue strip
in the figure above. To exchange the order of integration we instead
decompose the domain of integration $D$ into vertical strips, 
like the pink strip in the figure above. To do so, we observe that, on $D$,
\begin{itemize}
\item 
$x$ runs from $0$ to $3$ and
\item
for each fixed $x$ between $0$ and $3$, $y$ runs from $0$ to $x^2$.
\end{itemize}
That is, we reexpress the domain of integration as 
\begin{equation*}
D = \Set{(x,y)}{0\le x\le 3,\  0\le y\le x^2}
\end{equation*}
and the given integral as
\begin{align*}
\int_0^9\int_{\sqrt{y}}^3\sin(\pi x^3)\ \dee{x}\dee{y}
&=\int_0^3\dee{x} \int_0^{x^2}\dee{y}\ \sin(\pi x^3) \cr
&=\int_0^3\dee{x} \ x^2\sin(\pi x^3)\cr
&=\frac{1}{3\pi}\int_0^{27\pi}\dee{t}\ \sin t\quad\hbox{where }
    t=\pi x^3,\ \dee{t}=3\pi x^2\,\dee{x}\cr
&=-\frac{1}{3\pi}\cos t\Big|_0^{27\pi}=-\frac{1}{3\pi}\cos t\Big|_0^\pi
=\frac{2}{3\pi}\approx 0.212
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\begin{question}[M200 2000D] %6
The iterated integral
\begin{equation*}
I=\int_0^1\bigg[\int_{-\sqrt{x}}^{\sqrt{x}} \sin\big(y^3-3y\big)\,\dee{y}\bigg]
         \ \dee{x}
\end{equation*}
is equal to $\dblInt_R\sin\big(y^3-3y)\ dA$ for a suitable region $R$ in
the $xy$-plane.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Sketch the region $R$.

\item 
Write the integral $I$ with the orders of integration reversed,
and with suitable limits of integration.

\item 
Find $I$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{answer}

(b) $\dst\int_{-1}^1\bigg[\int_{y^2}^1 \sin\big(y^3-3y\big)\,\dee{x}\bigg]\ \dee{y}$
\qquad (c) $0$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
(a) In the given integral
\begin{itemize}
\item
$x$ runs from $0$ to $1$, and
\item
for each fixed $x$ between $0$ and $1$,
$y$ runs from $-\sqrt{x}$ to $\sqrt{x}$.
\end{itemize}
So the region
\begin{equation*}
R=\Set{(x,y)}{0\le x\le 1,\ -\sqrt{x}\le y\le \sqrt{x}}
\end{equation*}
It is sketched below.
\begin{center}

(b) The given integral was formed by decomposing
the domain of integration $R$ into vertical strips, like the pink strip
in the figure above. To exchange the order of integration we instead
decompose the domain of integration $R$ into horizontal strips, 
like the blue strip in the figure above. To do so, we observe that, on $R$,
\begin{itemize}
\item 
$y$ runs from $-1$ to $1$, and
\item
for each fixed $y$ between $-1$ and $1$, $x$ runs from $y^2$ to $1$.
\end{itemize}
So 
\begin{equation*}
I=\int_{-1}^1\bigg[\int_{y^2}^1 \sin\big(y^3-3y\big)\,\dee{x}\bigg]\ \dee{y}
\end{equation*}

(c) The easy way to evaluate $I$ is to observe that, since 
$\sin\big(y^3-3y\big)$ is odd under $y\rightarrow -y$, the integral
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-\sqrt{x}}^{\sqrt{x}} \sin\big(y^3-3y\big)\,\dee{y}=0
\end{equation*}
for all $x$. Hence $I=0$. The hard way is 
\begin{align*}
I&=\int_{-1}^1\bigg[\int_{y^2}^1 \sin\big(y^3-3y\big)\,\dee{x}\bigg]\ \dee{y}\\
&=\int_{-1}^1 (1-y^2) \sin\big(y^3-3y\big)\ \dee{y}\\
&=\int_2^{-2} \sin t\ \frac{\dee{t}}{-3}
\qquad\hbox{ where }t=y^3-3y,\ \dee{t} =3(y^2-1)\,\dee{y} \\
&=\frac{1}{3}\cos t\ \Big|_2^{-2}=0
\end{align*}
again, since $\cos$ is even.
\end{solution}

\begin{question}[M200 2000A] %7
Find the double integral of the function $f(x, y) = xy$
 over the region bounded by $y = x - 1$ and $y^2 = 2x + 6$.
\end{question}

%\begin{hint}
%
%\end{hint}

\begin{answer}
$36$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
The parabola $y^2=2x+6$ and the line $y=x-1$ meet when $x=y+1$
with $y^2=2(y+1)+6$ or $y^2-2y-8=(y-4)(y+2)=0$. So they meet at $(-1,-2)$ and $(5,4)$.
The domain of integration is sketched below. 
\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE00AQ7.pdf}
\end{center}
On this domain
\begin{itemize}
\item
$y$ runs from $-2$ to $4$, and
\item
for each fixed $y$ between $-2$ and $4$, $x$ runs from $\frac{y^2}{2}-3$
to $y+1$.
\end{itemize}
So the integral is 
\begin{align*}
\int_{-2}^4\dee{y}\int_{y^2/2-3}^{y+1}\dee{x}\ xy
&=\int_{-2}^4\dee{y}\ \frac{1}{2} x^2y\bigg|_{y^2/2-3}^{y+1} \\
&=\frac{1}{2}\int_{-2}^4\dee{y}\ 
                  \left[y^3+2y^2+y-\frac{1}{4}y^5+3y^3-9y\right] \\
&=\frac{1}{2}\int_{-2}^4\dee{y}\ \left[-8y+2y^2+4y^3-\frac{1}{4}y^5\right] \\
&=\left[-2y^2+\frac{1}{3}y^3+\frac{1}{2}y^4-\frac{1}{48}y^6\right]_{-2}^4 \\
&=-2(16-4)+\frac{1}{3}(64+8)+\frac{1}{2}(256-16)
-\frac{1}{48}(4096-64)\cr
&=-24+24+120-84=36
\end{align*}

\begin{question}
Find the volume of the solid inside the cylinder $x^2+2y^2=8$, above
the plane $z=y-4$ and below the plane $z=8-x$.
\end{question}

%\begin{hint}
%
%\end{hint}

\begin{answer}
$48\sqrt{2}\,\pi$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
Looking down from the top, we see the cylinder 
$x^2+2y^2\le 8$. That gives the base region. The top of the solid, above
any fixed $(x,y)$ in the base region, is at $z=8-x$ (this is always positive
because $x$ never gets bigger than $\sqrt{8}$) . The bottom 
of the solid, below any fixed $(x,y)$ in the base region, is at 
$z=y-4$ (this is always negative because $y$ is always smaller than $2$).
So the height of the solid at any $(x,y)$ is 
\begin{equation*}
z_{\rm top}-z_{\rm bottom}
=(8-x)-(y-4)=12-x-y
\end{equation*} 
The volume is
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-2}^{2}\dee{y}\int_{-\sqrt{8-2y^2}}^{\sqrt{8-2y^2}}\dee{x}\ (12-x-y)
\end{equation*}
Recall, from Theorem \eref{CLP101}{thm:INTevenodd} in the CLP-2 text, 
that if $f(x)$ is an odd function (meaning that
$f(-x)=-f(x)$ for all $x$), then $\int_{-a}^a f(x)\ \dee{x}=0$ (because the 
two integrals $\int_0^a f(x)\ \dee{x}$ and $\int_{-a}^0 f(x)\ \dee{x}$ have the 
same magnitude but opposite signs). Applying this twice gives
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-\sqrt{8-2y^2}}^{\sqrt{8-2y^2}}\dee{x}\ x=0\text{ and }
\int_{-2}^{2}\dee{y}\int_{-\sqrt{8-2y^2}}^{\sqrt{8-2y^2}}\dee{x}\ y
=\int_{-2}^{2}\dee{y}\ 2y\sqrt{8-2y^2}=0
\end{equation*}
since $x$ and $y\sqrt{8-2y^2}$ are both odd. Thus
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-2}^{2}\dee{y}\int_{-\sqrt{8-2y^2}}^{\sqrt{8-2y^2}}\dee{x}\ (-x-y)=0
\implies 
\text{Volume} = \int_{-2}^{2}\dee{y}\int_{-\sqrt{8-2y^2}}^{\sqrt{8-2y^2}}\dee{x}\ 
12
\end{equation*}
so that the volume is just 12 times the area of the ellipse $x^2+2y^2=8$,
which is
\begin{equation*}
12\big(\pi\,\sqrt{8}\,2\big)= 48\sqrt{2}\,\pi
\end{equation*}
\end{solution}

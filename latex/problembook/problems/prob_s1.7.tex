\begin{answer}
(a) $\leftrightarrow$ (C) \qquad
(b) $\leftrightarrow$ (F) \qquad
(c) $\leftrightarrow$ (D) \qquad
(d) $\leftrightarrow$ (B) \qquad
(e) $\leftrightarrow$ (A) \qquad
(f) $\leftrightarrow$ (E)
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
(a) $\varphi =\frac{\pi}{3}$ is a surface of constant (spherical coordinate)
$\varphi$. So it is a cone with vertex at the origin. We can express
$\varphi=\frac{\pi}{3}$ in cartesian coordinates by observing that
$0\le\varphi\le\frac{\pi}{2}$ so that $z\ge 0$, and
\begin{align*}
\varphi=\frac{\pi}{3}
\iff
\tan\varphi =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\iff
\rho\sin\varphi =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\rho\cos\varphi
\iff
\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} z
\end{align*}
So the picture that corresponds to (a) is (C).

(b) As $r$ and $\theta$ are cylindrical coordinates
\begin{align*}
r=2\cos\theta
\iff
r^2=2 r\cos\theta
\iff
x^2+y^2 = 2x
\iff
(x-1)^2+y^2=1
\end{align*}
There is no $z$ appearing in $(x-1)^2+y^2=1$. So every constant $z$
cross--section of $(x-1)^2+y^2=1$ is a (horizontal) circle of radius
$1$ centred on the line $x=1$, $y=0$. It is a cylinder of radius $1$
centred on the line $x=1$, $y=0$.
So the picture that corresponds to (b) is (F).

(c) Each constant $z$ cross--section of $x^2+y^2=z^2+1$ is a (horizontal)
circle centred on the $z$--axis. The radius of the circle is $1$
when $z=0$ and grows as $z$ moves away from $z=0$.  So
$x^2+y^2=z^2+1$ consists of a bunch of (horizontal) circles stacked
on top of each other, with the radius increasing with $|z|$. It
is a hyperboloid of one sheet. 
The picture that corresponds to (c) is (D).

(d) Every point of $y=x^2+z^2$ has $y\ge 0$. Only (B) has that 
property. We can also observe that every constant $y$ cross--section
is a circle centred on $x=z=0$. The radius of the circle is zero
when $y=0$ and increases as $y$ increases. The surface $y=x^2+z^2$
is a paraboloid.
The picture that corresponds to (d) is (B).

(e) As $\rho$ and $\varphi$ are spherical coordinates
\begin{align*}
\rho=2\cos\varphi
\iff
\rho^2=2\rho\cos\varphi
\iff
x^2+y^2+z^2=2z
\iff
x^2+y^2 + (z-1)^2=1
\end{align*}
This is the sphere of radius $1$ centred on $(0,0,1)$.
The picture that corresponds to (e) is (A).

(f) The only possibility left is that the picture that
corresponds to (f) is (E).
\end{solution}

\end{answer}


\begin{solution}
Each solution below consists of three sketchs.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
In the first sketch, we just redraw the given level curves with the
$x$- and $y$-axes reoriented so that the sketch looks like we are high on the $z$-axis looking down at the $xy$-plane.

\item 
In the second sketch, we lift up each level curve $f(x,y)=C$ and draw it in 
the horizontal plane $z=C$. That is we draw 
\begin{align*}
&\Set{(x,y,z)}{f(x,y)=C,\ z=C,\ x\ge 0, y\ge 0} \\
&\hskip1in=\Set{(x,y,z)}{z=f(x,y),\ z=C,\ x\ge 0, y\ge 0}
\end{align*}

\item
Finally, in the third sketch, we draw the part of graph $z=f(x,y)$ in the
first octant, just by ``filling in the gaps in the second sketch''.

\begin{question}
Sketch a few level curves for the function $f(x,y)$ whose graph $z=f(x,y)$
is sketched below.

\end{question}

\begin{hint}
Draw in the plane $z=C$ for several values of $C$. 
\end{hint}


\begin{answer}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{hyperCylinderLevel.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{answer}


\begin{solution}
We first add into the sketch of the graph the horizontal planes $z=C$,
for $C=3$, $2$, $1$, $0.5$, $0.25$. 
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{hyperCylinderGraphB.pdf}
\end{center}
To reduce clutter, for each $C$, we have drawn in only 
\begin{itemize}
\item 
the (gray) intersection of the horizontal plane $z=C$ with the $yz$--plane,
i.e. with the vertical plane $x=0$, and
\item
the (blue) intersection of the horizontal plane $z=C$ with the graph $z=f(x,y)$.
\end{itemize} 
We have also omitted the label for the plane $z=0.25$.

The intersection of the plane $z=C$ with the graph $z=f(x,y)$ is line
\begin{equation*}
\Set{(x,y,z)}{z=f(x,y),\ z=C} =  \Set{(x,y,z)}{f(x,y)=C,\ z=C}
\end{equation*}
Drawing this line (which is parallel to the $x$-axis) in the $xy$-plane,
rather than in the plane $z=C$, gives a level curve. Doing this for each of
$C=3$, $2$, $1$, $0.5$, $0.25$ gives five level curves.

Sketch some of the level curves of
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $f(x,y)=x^2+2y^2$
\item $f(x,y)=xy$
\item $f(x,y)=xe^{-y}$

(c)
\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{levelLog.pdf}
\end{center}

\end{answer}

\begin{solution} (a)
For each fixed $c>0$, the level curve $x^2+2y^2=c$ is the ellipse
centred on the origin with $x$ semi axis $\sqrt{c}$ and 
$y$ semi axis $\sqrt{c/2}$. If $c=0$,  the level curve $x^2+2y^2=c=0$
is the single point $(0,0)$.
\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{levelEllipse.pdf}
\end{center}

(b)
For each fixed $c\ne 0$, the level curve $xy=c$ is a hyperbola
centred on the origin with asymptotes the $x$- and $y$-axes. 
If $c>0$, any $x$ and $y$ obeying $xy=c>0$ are of the same sign.
So the hyperbola is contained in the first and third quadrants.
If $c<0$, any $x$ and $y$ obeying $xy=c>0$ are of opposite sign.
So the hyperbola is contained in the second and fourth quadrants.
If $c=0$,  the level curve $xy=c=0$
is the single point $(0,0)$.
\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{levelHyperbola.pdf}
\end{center}

(c)
For each fixed $c\ne 0$, the level curve $xe^{-y}=c$ is the logarithmic curve
$y=-\ln\frac{c}{x}$. Note that, for $c>0$, the curve
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item is restricted to $x>0$, so that $\frac{c}{x}>0$ and $\ln \frac{c}{x}$
  is defined, and that
\item as $x\rightarrow 0^+$, $y$ goes to $-\infty$, while
\item as $x\rightarrow +\infty$, $y$ goes to $+\infty$, and
\item the curve crosses the $x$-axis (i.e. has $y=0$) when $x=c$.
\end{itemize}
and for $c<0$, the curve
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item is restricted to $x<0$, so that $\frac{c}{x}>0$ and $\ln \frac{c}{x}$
  is defined, and that
\item as $x\rightarrow 0^-$, $y$ goes to $-\infty$, while
\item as $x\rightarrow -\infty$, $y$ goes to $+\infty$, and
\item the curve crosses the $x$-axis (i.e. has $y=0$) when $x=c$.
\end{itemize}
If $c=0$,  the level curve $xe^{-y}=c=0$
is the $y$-axis, $x=0$.

Sketch the level curves of $f(x,y)=\frac{2y}{x^2+y^2}$.

%\end{hint}

\begin{answer}
\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE10D_1.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
 If $C=0$, the level curve $f=C=0$ is just the line $y=0$.
If $C\ne 0$ (of either sign), we may rewrite the equation, $f(x,y)=\frac{2y}{x^2+y^2}=C$,
of the level curve $f=C$ as 
\begin{equation*}
x^2-\frac{2}{C}y+y^2=0
\iff x^2+\left(y-\frac{1}{C}\right)^2 =\frac{1}{C^2} 
\end{equation*}
which is the equation of the circle of radius $\frac{1}{|C|}$ centred on
$\left(0\,,\,\frac{1}{C}\right)$.

\begin{center}
     \includegraphics{OE10D_1.pdf}
\end{center}

\emph{Remark.}\ \  
To be picky, the function $f(x,y)=\frac{2y}{x^2+y^2}$
is not defined at $(x,y)=(0,0)$. The question should have either specified
that the domain of $f$ excludes $(0,0)$ or have specified a value 
for $f(0,0)$. In fact, it is impossible to assign a value to $f(0,0)$
in such a way that $f(x,y)$ is continuous at $(0,0)$, because
$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}f(x,0)=0$ while  $\lim_{y\rightarrow 0}f(0,|y|)=\infty$.
So it makes more sense to have the domain of $f$ being $\bbbr^2$  
with the point $(0,0)$ removed. That's why there is a little hole at the origin
in the above sketch.

 Observe that, for any constant $C$, the curve $-x^2+4y^2=C$
is the level curve $f=e^C$.
\begin{itemize}
\item
If $C=0$, then $-x^2+4y^2=C=0$ is the pair of lines $y=\pm\frac{x}{2}$.
\item
If $C>0$, then $-x^2+4y^2=C>0$ is the hyperbola $y=\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{C+x^2}$.

If $C<0$, then $-x^2+4y^2=C<0$ is the hyperbola $x=\pm\sqrt{|C|+4y^2}$.

   \raisebox{0.1\height}{\includegraphics[scale=1.2]{OE253_11D_1br.pdf}}
\end{center}
\end{answer}

\begin{solution} (a)
We can rewrite the equation as 
\begin{equation*}
x^2 + y^2 = (z-1)^2 - 1
\end{equation*}
The right hand side is negative for $|z-1|<1$, i.e. for $0<z<2$.
So no point on the surface has $0<z<2$. For any 
fixed $z$, outside that range, the curve $x^2 + y^2 = (z-1)^2 - 1$ 
is the circle of radius $\sqrt{(z-1)^2 - 1}$ centred on the $z$--axis.
That radius is $0$ when $z=0,2$ and increases as $z$ moves away from 
$z=0,2$. For very large $|z|$, the radius increases roughly linearly with
$|z|$. Here is a sketch of some level curves.

(b)
The surface consists of two stacks of circles. 
One stack starts with radius $0$ at $z=2$. 
The radius increases as $z$ increases.
The other stack starts with radius $0$ at $z=0$. 
The radius increases as $z$ decreases.
This surface is a hyperboloid of two sheets. Here are two

\end{center}
\end{answer}

\begin{solution} 
For each fixed $z$, $4x^2+y^2=1+z^2$ is an ellipse. So the surface 
consists of a stack of ellipses one on top of the other. The semi axes are
$\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+z^2}$ and $\sqrt{1+z^2}$. These are smallest when $z=0$
(i.e. for the ellipse in the $xy$-plane) and increase as $|z|$ increases.
The intersection of the surface with the $xz$-plane (i.e. with the plane $y=0$) is the hyperbola $4x^2-z^2=1$ and the intersection with
the $yz$-pane (i.e. with the plane $x=0$) is the hyperbola $y^2-z^2=1$. 
Here are two sketches of the surface. The sketch on the left only shows 
the part of the surface in the first octant  (with axes).

\end{answer}

\begin{solution} (a)
 The graph is $z=\sin x$ with $(x,y)$ running over
$0\le x\le 2\pi$,  $0\le y\le 1$. For each fixed $y_0$ between $0$ and $1$, 
the intersection of this graph with the vertical plane $y=y_0$ is the
same sin graph $z=\sin x$ with $x$ running from $0$ to $2\pi$. So the whole
graph is just a bunch of 2-d sin graphs stacked side-by-side. This gives
the graph on the left below.

\begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=1.05]{sinGraph.pdf}\qquad\qquad
   \raisebox{-0.1\height}{\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{coneGraph.pdf}}
\end{center}

(b) 
The graph is $z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. For each fixed $z_0\ge 0$, 
the intersection of this graph with the horizontal plane $z=z_0$ is the
circle $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=z_0$. This circle is centred on the $z$-axis
and has radius $z_0$. So the graph is the upper half of a cone. It is the
sketch on the right above.

(c) 
The graph is $z=|x|+|y|$. For each fixed $z_0\ge 0$, 
the intersection of this graph with the horizontal plane $z=z_0$ is the
square $|x|+|y|=z_0$. The side of the square with $x,y\ge 0$ is the straight
line $x+y=z_0$. The side of the square with $x\ge 0$ and $y\le 0$ is 
the straight line $x-y=z_0$ and so on. The four corners of the square are
$(\pm z_0,0,z_0)$ and $(0, \pm z_0,z_0)$.  So the graph is a stack of squares.
It is an upside down four-sided pyramid. The part of the pyramid in the
first octant (that is, $x,y,z\ge 0$) is the sketch below.

(a) 
For each fixed $z_0$, the $z=z_0$ cross-section (parallel to the $xy$-plane) 
of this surface is an ellipse centered on the origin with
one semiaxis of length 2 along the $x$-axis and one semiaxis of length 
4 along the $y$-axis. So this is an elliptic cylinder parallel to the $z$-axis.

For each fixed $x_0$, the $x=x_0$ 
cross-section parallel to the $yz$-plane is an ellipse with semiaxes 
$3\sqrt{1+\frac{x_0^2}{16}}$ parallel to the $y$-axis and
$2\sqrt{1+\frac{x_0^2}{16}}$ parallel to the $z$-axis. 
 As you move out along the $x$-axis, away from $x=0$, the ellipses grow
at a rate proportional to $\sqrt{1+\frac{x^2}{16}}$, which for large $x$
is approximately $\frac{|x|}{4}$.
This is called a hyperboloid of one sheet. Its

For each fixed $y_0$, the $y=x_0$ cross-section (parallel to the $xz$-plane) 
is a circle of radius $|y|$ centred on the $y$-axis. When $y_0=0$ the radius 
is $0$. As you move further from the $xz$-plane, in either direction, 
i.e. as $|y_0|$ increases, the radius grows linearly. The full surface 
consists of a bunch of these circles stacked sideways. This is a 
circular cone centred on the $y$-axis.

=b+4+\frac{b^2}{4}+\frac{81}{4}$.

(g)
There are no points on the surface with $x<0$.
For each fixed $x_0>0$ the cross-section $x=x_0$ parallel to the
$yz$-plane is an ellipse centred on the $x$--axis with semiaxes $\sqrt{x_0}$ 
in the $y$-axis direction and $\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{x_0}$ in the $z$--axis
direction.  As you increase $x_0$, i.e. move out along the $x$-axis, 
the ellipses grow at a rate proportional to $\sqrt{x_0}$. This is 
an elliptic paraboloid  with axis the $x$-axis.

The surface below has circular level curves, centred along the $z$-axis. The lines given are the intersection of the surface with the right half of the $yz$-plane. Give an equation for the surface.

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{question}
\begin{hint}
Since the level curves are circles centred at the origin (in the $xy$-plane), the equation will have the form $x^2+y^2=g(z)$, where $g(z)$ is a function depending only on $z$.
\end{hint}
\begin{answer}
$\displaystyle x^2+y^2=\left( \frac{|z|}{3}+1\right)^2$
\end{answer}
\begin{solution}
Since the level curves are circles centred at the origin (in the $xy$-plane), when $z$ is a constant, the equation will have the form $x^2+y^2=c$ for some constant. That is, our equation looks like
\[x^2+y^2=g(z),\] where $g(z)$ is a function depending only on $z$.


Because our cross-sections are so nicely symmetric, we know the intersection of the figure with the left side of the $yz$-plane as well: $z=3(-y-1)=-3(y+1)$ 
(when $z\ge0$) and $z=-3(-y-1)=3(y+1)$ (when $z<0$). Below is the intersection of our surface with the $yz$ plane.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,-3)--(0,3)node[above]{$z$};
\draw (-3,0)--(3,0) node[right]{$y$};
%\draw (0,0)--(-1,-1) node[below left]{$x$};

\draw[very thick, dashed] (1,0)--(2.25,3.75)node[right]{$z=3(y-1)$};
\draw[very thick, dashed] (1,0)--(2.25,-3.75)node[right]{$z=-3(y-1)$};

\draw[very thick, dashed] (-1,0)--(-2.25,3.75)node[left]{$z=-3(y+1)$};
\draw[very thick, dashed] (-1,0)--(-2.25,-3.75)node[left]{$z=3(y+1)$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Setting $x=0$, our equation becomes $y^2=g(z)$. Looking at the right side of the $yz$ plane, this should lead to:
$\left.\begin{cases}
z=3(y-1) &\mbox{if } z\geq 0,\ y\ge 1\\
z=-3(y-1) &\mbox{if } z< 0,\ y\ge 1
\end{cases}\right\} $. That is:

\begin{align*}
|z|&=3(y-1)\\
\frac{|z|}{3}+1&=y\\
\left(\frac{|z|}{3}+1\right)^2&=y^2 &(*)
\end{align*}

A quick check: when we squared both sides of the equation in $(*)$, we added another solution, $\frac{|z|}{3}+1=-y$. Let's make sure we haven't diverged from our diagram.

\begin{align*}
&&& \left(\frac{|z|}{3}+1\right)^2=y^2\\
&\Leftrightarrow&& \underbrace{\frac{|z|}{3}+1}_{\text{positive}}=\pm y\\
&\Leftrightarrow&& \begin{cases}
 \frac{|z|}{3}+1 =y & y>0\\[0.05in]
  \frac{|z|}{3}+1 =-y & y<0
 \end{cases}\displaybreak[0]\\[0.1in]
& \Leftrightarrow&& \begin{cases}
 \frac{|z|}{3}+1 =y & y\ge1\\[0.05in]
  \frac{|z|}{3}+1 =-y & y\le-1
 \end{cases}\displaybreak[0]\\[0.1in]
&\Leftrightarrow&&  \begin{cases}
|z| =3(y-1) & y\ge1\\[0.05in]
|z|=-3(y+1) & y\le-1
 \end{cases}\displaybreak[0]\\[0.1in]
&\Leftrightarrow&&  \begin{cases}
z =\pm \underbrace{3(y-1)}_{\text{positive}} & y\ge1\\
z=\pm \underbrace{3(y+1)}_{\text{negative}} & y\le-1
 \end{cases}\displaybreak[0]\\[0.1in]
&\Leftrightarrow&&  \begin{cases}
z =3(y-1) & y\ge1,\ z\ge0\\
z =-3(y-1) & y\ge1,\ z\le0\\
z=-3(y+1) & y\le-1,\ z \ge 0\\
z=3(y+1) & y\le-1,\ z\le 0
 \end{cases}
\end{align*}

This matches our diagram eactly. So, all together, the equation of the surface is
\[x^2+y^2=\left( \frac{|z|}{3}+1\right)^2\]
\end{solution}
